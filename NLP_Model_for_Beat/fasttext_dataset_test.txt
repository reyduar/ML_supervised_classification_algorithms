__label__5 my husband and i ate here tonight for the first time and it will not be our last !  the fried chicken is best i ' ve ever had  and my ppl are from south carolina !  his sauce is very very good !  and the owner was very hospitable and spoke to us about the  history of this famous restaurant .  they will be taping on rachel ray ' s show next week !  kudos y ' all ! 
__label__5 seti ' s truck wasn ' t around so we decided to head to a restaurant with polish boys that didn ' t have wheels .  i ' m really glad we did that - the combo of the polish .  .  . girl .  .  . was delicious !   it had the added pulled pork on it ,  the combo of flavors ,  perfect .     what the fam really loved was that sauce .   i ' ll probably never be in cleveland again ,  but i ' ll dream of that sauce .   we got the fried chicken ,  stuck the sauce on the side .  .  . but i can see why people just have it drenching that chicken .   glad we did get it on the side ,  though ,  since it was glorious to dip everything into it .   almost ordered another fries just as a vehicle for the hot sauce . 
__label__4 hot sauce williams is a cleveland tradition !  i will always stop here for the fries with sauce ! 
__label__1 worst food i ' ve ever had the laziest service .  we ended up throwing 35 dollars in the trash .  if you like getting sick or experience all time lows check this place out ! 
__label__2 the polish girl was good overall but the sauce was a little too sweet for my taste .  the fried chicken was also a plus . 
__label__2 so torn .  i love their food .  we wanted a polish boy .  yelp says open until 1:30 ,  it is 10:26 pm and drive thru dude says they ' re closed .  what ?  if you ' re normal and visit during normal hours ,  i gave hsw 5 plus stars .  but consistence is nice too . 
__label__5 i genuinely love this place .    my one request is that this place should start a delivery service .  the neighborhood isn ' t the best ,  and since all my friends in cleveland are case students ,  no one is really inclined to answer my fried chicken hankering at 10pm because to them ,  the fear of getting shot is too damn high  ( but i think i could die happy with some hsw in my hands )  . 
__label__4 chicken and sides were fantastic .   i like my bbq better but neat place with good chicken . 
__label__5 driven past that ostentatious sign out front plenty of times but a little reluctant to stop and try their food .  should have definitely stopped by earlier .   2 words: fried chicken .  ridiculously good .  the chicken looked like it had been sitting under the heating lamp a little too long but it was super crunchy and super juicy .  i have no clue what they put in it but who cares .   mashed potatoes were awesome .  a little runny for my taste but delicious goodness .  cole slaw was good but a little too much sauce and not enough crunch .  definitely have to get back there when i get a chance .    order cafeteria style and if you don ' t know what you want they ' ll be happy to help you out .  then grab a seat and enjoy your meal .  strangely enough they have a vending machine in the dining area so i guess it really is like a cafeteria . 
__label__4 best fried chicken i ever had .  went with 12 people and we ordered almost everything on the menu .  none of us were disappointed .  well worth the stop .  collared greens were awsome  !  sauce was delicious
__label__3 first off ,  yes this place is pretty ratchet and in a sketchy neighborhood .  if you can get past that ,  its definitely worth a stop .  i had the polish girl ,  with the pulled pork .  the pork itself was kind of tasteless ,  the bbq sauce kind of overpowered everything for me .  the sauce was also a little too spicy for my liking ,  but not terrible .  the mac and cheese was mediocre .  there are other better dive restaurants here in cle for bbq ,  but this place isn ' t terrible . 
__label__5 hsw is the best .     best fried chicken north of the mason / dixon .  i have enjoyed hsw many times over the years .    tried the ribs for the first time ,  delicious .    great food ,  will be back again and again and again .   thank you hsw for offering this fine food in the cleveland area . 
__label__2 omg !   i have been eating there of and on for years and the quality has just gone down .   i don ' t know why but the meat seems to be of lower quality and poor cut .   the service is no longer stellar as it used to be .   i ordered a simple rib dinner and the ribs were stringy and tough and the fries were mush .   i dont like to give poor ratings but this is just not the level of service that i know hot sauce used to give and it needs to be rectified . 
__label__4 i enjoyed the fried chicken and found the ribs to be rather tasty .  i love soul food ! 
__label__1 we decided to grab a quick meal before heading off to the nearby airport .  but i felt the place wasn ' t the cleanliest and our waitress smelled of bad bo ,  that was very noticeable and distracting .  we ordered some omelettes and hash browns and it was quite lacking in flavor .  i know it ' s a chain ,  but i ' ve seen much better . 
__label__1 i haven ' t been to a denny ' s in years .  .  .  .  .  . used to love the slam breakfasts and the shredded potato hashbrowns .  .  .  .  .  . but memories were ruined by what is now denny ' s .  for starters ,  what could i expect .  .  .  . it ' s a classic greasy spoon style restaurant ,  but i ' ve been to plenty of greasy spoons before ,  but they usually have great ,  friendly service and the food is served up quick and hot .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  our server was the poorest excuse for a server i ' ve ever experienced .  even with the name tag celebrating his 14 years of service .  it took 30 minutes to get breakfast in a restaurant that was virtually empty .  our server was more consumed with reading a magazine in the server station than filling our coffee ,  water and teas .  .  .  .  .  . the coffee ,  by the way ,  was full of grounds ,  had to ask for another cup of coffee ,  sans grounds .  food was sub-par ,  server asked how everything was ,  after we had eaten it ,  .  leaving alot of it uneate .  we asked for the check ,  he disappered ,  we waited another 10 minutes ,  then finally asked the hostess for our check ,  paid and left .  .  .  .  .  the best part of this meal was seeing denny ' s in my rear view mirror !  !  !  ! 
__label__1 i left .  we were greeted ,  seated and drinks were brought out .  then .  .  .  .  .  .  nothing .  we waited and waited .  crickets chirped ,  other customer came in .  they were seated and drinks brought out for them .  then the last straw for me was when their waitress took their order ,  whilst ignoring us .  so we decided to leave .  i walked to the clerk ,  asked for the bill for the coffee .  the hostess who seated us ,  asked what happened .  we told her and she did try to get us to stay and comp our meal ,  but i was ticked and couldn ' t enjoy myself if i stayed .  so we left . 
__label__5 went in for a meeting this morning .  great food and drinks .  the server was excellent coming in to refill drinks but not bugging us . 
__label__5 food was amazingly complex .  atmosphere was relaxing .  the place was packed on the saturday we visited - and for good reason .   an experience like no other in the cleveland area .  staff was fantastic .  mint tea was perfect .   main course was delicious .    i highly recommend momo ' s - try it and you too will be pleasantly surprised . 
__label__5 on a sunday after church drive down lee ,  momo ' s kebab caught our eyes .  a quick search on yelp intrigued my husband and i to venture into the small restaurant where we found a quiet dining room with a few small tables and chairs .  the room was clean ,  with a mediterranean ambiance ,  and we were soon greeted by the owner ,  who i believe makes all of the food as well !  there is a story about his travels and his passion for cooking on the menu .  we could tell this man puts his heart and soul into his food and his restaurant and takes great pride in his work .  of course ,  with this approach to cooking ,  the food was absolutely incredible .  freshly prepared warm whole wheat bread was brought to the table .  everything on the menu looked great so we ordered a little of everything .  we both ordered one of the two soup options .  i don ' t remember what it was called ,  but it had lots of lentils and vegetables .  it was very nice ,  perfect portion ,  perfect temperature ,  and flavorful .  we both ordered beef kebab and received a side salad with the order .  all of the vegetables in the salad were very crisp and fresh .  the dressing was homemade .  for a complimentary salad that came with our meal ,  this went above and beyond .  now let me rave about the beef kebabs !  they were really wonderful as well !  the meat was tender ,  juicy ,  not tough or dry as in some mediterranean restaurants .  it was a little spicy ,  which i enjoyed .  it came with rice ,  grilled vegetables ,  and salsa .  it was a perfect portion with beautiful presentation and excellent flavors .  also ,  we really loved the hot green tea !  we both shared one pot .  it was very high quality green tea brewed to perfection with a touch of honey .  truly i have never tasted such a delicious green tea .  i will definitely be returning to momo ' s kebab .  i really want to try one of their specials on thursday ,  friday ,  or saturday night . 
__label__4 i wanted to try some different regional cuisines ,  and while looking up restaurants in cleveland heights i happened upon a restaurant that was advertised as moroccan cuisine .    this was my first time having moroccan cuisine ,  and i was thoroughly impressed .  i got the beef tagine ,  and there isn ' t anything quite like beef and vegetables that have been stewed for a very long period of time .  the beef was juicy and tender ,  and because it was stewed ,  the meat was very easy to cut and quite tasty .  the carrots and potatoes were also super soft .   i also got the lamb platter ,  which likewise came with an assortment of vegetables as well as some rice .  the lamb was pretty good too ,  though not as amazing as the tagine .   both entrees came with salad and bread .  the salad was fairly standard ,  but the bread was incredibly tasty and well seasoned . 
__label__5 i have seen momo ' s kebab for some months and wanted to try it .  my son and i dined there tonight and had a great meal .  the moroccan tea was delish and the salads with freshly baked whole wheat bread rolls were very fresh and tasty .  my son had the beef kebab and i had the kefta kebab and they were both lovely; the hot sauce was good - spicy without being overwhelming .  both meals came with rice and grilled vegis ,  and the whole meal was under $25 .  the chief / owner was very personable and interesting to talk with .  i hope his business continues to expand as he explained to us .  it was a treat of an evening out and i definitely will be back . 
__label__2 mehdible .   while portion sizes were ample ,  the chief operating principle of this venue appears to be "drown it in oil . "  you can imagine how unfortunate that might be with the "fancy tofu" dish ,  which was more of a rubbery oil-soaked sponge dish .   i ' m not sure how one manages to do that to tofu or why anyone would want to ,  but apparently it ' s possible .   i ' d also ordered the fried scallops .   again ,  ample offerings ,  but it was a breaded fried offering .  .  .  drowned in oil .   as you can imagine ,  that gave it a very soggy texture ,  which seemed to defeat the purpose of having breaded and fried it in the first place .   there ' s much better chinese food to be had in cleveland .   several of those venues have just as reasonably-priced ,  but better-tasting seafood on the menu . 
__label__2 the scariest thing in this place is the wait in line .    now ,  big crowds are good for business and to their credit ,  the wait is indoors .  but the long wait was not worth it .  i ' ve always been a big fan of haunted houses .  some are good ,  most are awful .  unfortunately ,  this one fits into the later category .  immediately upon entry you are blasted with extremely loud rock music .  it felt more like a grunge bar scene than a haunted house .  after an hour in line we finally reach the first of 5 "haunted houses" .  the sets are ok ,  that is until you look up and are reminded that you ' re inside of an old department store with drop ceiling .  also ,  you can still hear the blaring rock music which doesn ' t help with the ambiance .  they let each group go about 20 seconds after one another .  which means that you inevitably run into the group ahead of you ,  ruining any chance at any jump scares .  this is the biggest ruiner of haunted houses .  by the end of each house ,  it ' s just a long line of people walking through the end of it .  the final haunt  ( the circus themed one )  was the least terrible .  they play with your senses a bit ,  which i thought was good .  but that was short lived .    then there was the zombie laser shooting part ,  which i was most looking forward to .  they are on to something fun ,  but it was over in about 5 minutes ,  no exaggeration .  if they scraped all of the other houses and made one big zombie laser shooting maze ,  in which you pay extra to be the only group inside of for a while ,  then they may have something .  i would pay good money for that .    overall ,  for the price ,  i cannot recommend this place .  if you want a decent haunted house ,  with good ambiance and less crowds ,  go to the mansfield reformatory haunted house or the akron haunted school house . 
__label__2 i hate to go with a 2 star ,  but i was just so underwhelmed .  watching the videos ,  i was prepared to be scared .  appreciating the makeup video ,  i knew i ' d have a shock ,  a shiver ,  a jump outta my sneakers .  nope ,  zip ,  nothing .   i went last evening  ( sat )  around 8pm and just missed the rush !   no wait to go in ,  a brief  ( 10min  )  wait to purchase tickets ,  although i could have purchased them online and avoided the 10 min .  .  .  but if you don ' t get a fast or immediate pass .  .  . don ' t do it .  .  .  not worth it .  .  .  my wait was almost an hour in a line maze like cedar point .    sure ,  a cool ,  creepy zombie passed thru the line to pass time ,  but heck ,  not enough of it .   once in the first house ,  it only takes about 10 minutes to get through .  zombies jump out at you and bang the walls for effect .  settings and scenes are pretty cool ,  but in the great scheme of things ,  terribly over rated !     .  .  . to make matters worse ,  the groups were pushed through too quickly ,  so  crap ,  by the time we got to the third house ,  the group before us was right in front of us ,  so forget the fact that we knew what was going to jump out .  .  .  .  the poor actors didn ' t have a chance to go back into hiding and we knew where they would jump from ,  go game over .   can i get my money back .  .  .  at least half since half if my journey was ripped from me ?    when we left ,  the line was crazy long just to get in ,  so don ' t go late and definitely not on a weekend .  not even worth the wait !   pass ,  next !  not going here again ! 
__label__1 you can smell the fear in the air !  no wait i mean the smell of piss .  this place stunk so bad it ruined the entire experience . 
__label__5 by far ,  the best haunted house i have been to .  4 haunted houses together .  people were dropping like flies heading for the exits .  the couple in front of me ,  who i kept accidentally running into ,  didn ' t even notice because they were in a zombie like state by the end .  everyone looked spent coming out .  the acting was superb and the actors never broke character even when their friends and family came through to see them .  the last haunted house ,  district 13 ,  i could have done without which was just strobe lights and lasers and me getting dizzy .  but other than that ,  great job .  try to go with a group .  i only went with my husband but by the end we and the few groups ahead of us and behind were nearly family ,  and we had a great time getting each other riled up . 
__label__4 totally worth it !  we went on a friday night about 10 pm .  line for tickets was 10 minutes ,  line to get into the houses was about 30 .  i thought looking at the front of the four houses they would be quick walkthroughs ,  but there were a lot of twists ,  turns ,  and dead ends that made it a good 10-15 minutes each .  lots of "jump out and scream in your face" actors ,  but plenty of other scares ,  too .  the last house was by far the best .  i ' ll absolutely have nightmares for a while .  my favorite part was the attention to details in all the houses .  there was one acres who must have been a contortionist and she was perfect !  my only suggestion is that screaming isn ' t the only way to frighten people .  sometimes a creepy muttering or a whisper is far more effective . 
__label__3 good beers on tap .   friendly .   sporty theme .  pub fare with a few twists .   tavern salad is excellent .  fried fish and seafood specials .  yummy fries . 
__label__3 a group of friends and i all came here this past saturday night .  when we walked in  ( probably around 11:30 )  the place was decently crowded ,  but not overly so .  we were able to walk right up to the bar and we ' re served right away .  none of us ordered anything more than bud light ,  so i can ' t speak for the quality of any other drinks .        there is definitely an interesting mix of people here .  the bartenders all seemed to have tattoos and piercings and were very nice ,  then there were hipster looking people as well as people who were dressed business casual .  i do think they need to keep a closer eye on overserving people ,  because right when we walked in until we left around 1 ,  a guy that was sitting at the bar would not stop harassing my friend and our group .  he seemed to barely be able to talk or have any idea what he was doing .        overall it was an okay experience .  i ' m not dying to go back ,  but i also wouldn ' t avoid the place either . 
__label__5 hands down our favorite stroll to place !    i used to love the old abc and i was sad when i heard it had been sold .  not anymore .  the food here is consistently great and the servers are always friendly .  we like to sit outside and people watch and sip a cold "fancy beer" .  the food always comes too soon !   their menu items and beer list are always changing ,  so we are never bored ! 
__label__2 my mom just had her car serviced at motorcars .  when she went to pick up the car the employee pointed at her car at the end of the garage and gave her the key .  i would expect that the service department employees would bring the car to the customer .  that is poor customer service .  the employee assumed that my mom could walk a far distance ,  which is a incorrect assumption . 
__label__3 i really like going out clubbing and experiencing the downtown scene .   it ' s a relatively small club compared to a lot of the other places on w .  6th .     anatomy is decorated relatively nicely with modern decor and bar .   the bathrooms are really clean with a attendant .   the drinks a little over priced for what you get even though it is downtown .   i can ' t even taste the alcohol in the drinks- a dirty martini just tastes like olive juice and a cran- vodka tastes like cranberry juice .   i paid 8 . 00 for a cran-vodka .   the bartenders were very attentive though .   at barflyy ,  i can get a crown royal ,  peach schnapps concoction for 6 . 50 and quick service .       i wasn ' t too impressed with the djs that played ,  but that changes easily with the venue .   plenty of cute guys ,  when i went for the eastern bloc party ,  who offered drinks though .  :d .   i don ' t think that anatomy is usually too packed unless there is some venue going on . 
__label__4 i ' ve been to roseangel once ,  about a month after it opened ,  on a sunday evening .   i believe my group comprised all the customers in attendance throughout the entire meal ,  and the staff and owner could not have been more attentive or congenial .   everything was good ,  and most things were great .   i had the duck confit  ( crunchy shell )  and seared tuna  ( soft shell )  .   the duck was delicious; the tuna was nice ,  but not mind-blowing .   my table ordered one of the salsas  ( unfortunately ,  i don ' t remember which ,  but it was heavy on avocado and garlic ,  if that helps )  ,  and it was incredible .   my biggest disappointment was my drink .   i really enjoyed the cocktail i had had at luxe a few weeks earlier ,  and was looking forward to a creative combination of flavors .   i ordered the perpetula ,  a "cucumber & lemon mojito with bacardi and and fresh mint , " which had a lovely cucumber and mint flavor but did not really taste of alcohol at all ,  and not in a good way .   as far as cucumber and mint-infused water goes ,  it was great ,  but there was no way i was getting a buzz off of that drink .   maybe it was a bad night for the bartender ,  because with drink descriptions like roseangel ' s ,  i ' d expect drinks with a kick .   the decor is rich and beautiful ,  in my opinion .   definitely very festive and trendy .   i ' ll definitely be back for duck tacos and guacamole ,  and i look forward to getting their happy hour prices  ( $4 . 25 a la carte for those tacos is already really good )  . 
__label__3 great salsa selection and  the three i tried were great .  the margaritas were just okay .  same with the tacos  . i ordered the spicy chicken taco  ( which wasn ' t spicy )  and the roasted pork and potato  ( but there was no potato on the taco )  .  i would recommend just going for drinks and chips and salsa ,  not dinner .  the tacos are just too pricey for nothing special . 
__label__5  ! woot .   a game store that i give 5 stars to .   i am going to return to this store .   depending on who works there ,  the environment can feel kind of rough .   this place deserves more customers !  !  !  they have a ton of older generation consoles and they have new .   the trade in isn ' t that great ,  but other then that ,  please go shop their because .  .  . and get this .  .  .  . they have famicom games .   i saw it .  .  . they keep some in a box and all the games have great prices .   i saw 20 and none of them were over 10 dollars .   they have imports for almost everything .   i was blown away .   but it seems so dark in there and like i said depending on who is working .   but i have learned more about video games and i am expecting to go back .   i live like 40 minutes away from the store and i don ' t get to make it there that often .   you park in the back of the building ,  but it ' s really easy to miss .   this is a game store you cannot miss .   the prices are moderate ,  but they do exceed the value of the product .        -thanks
__label__1 awful place ,  just awful .   from double charging our bill on our credit card  ( both different amounts )  to putting other peoples sandwiches on my friends ck  ( and refusing to fix it ,  manager threatened to call the police )  to changing the tip .   watch your credit card or better yet ,  pay with cash .   i refuse to eat here ,  drink here ,  or support this dump .   and the patio has got to be the most god-awful patio in cleveland .   just bad . 
__label__4 one of my favorite places for an impulsive dinner out .   the best calamari in town !   the pulled pork sandwich with blue cheese slaw is fantastic with a cool draught of magic hat no .  9 .   i have always had friendly ,  attentive service .  the prices are reasonable for the quality of the food .   give this place a try ! 
__label__4 lava lounge is such a gem in the tremont neighborhood .  it ' s laid back ,  has good food and beers on tap ,  and is a perfect spot for a chill evening .    i love all of the vegetarian options that they have in the menu ,  my favorites being the fried cauliflower and the portobello mushroom taco !   ( i don ' t even like portobellos but that thing is delicious !  )   the service is kind of hit or miss .  some of the bartenders are so apathetic and others are spunky and fun ! 
__label__3 we always end up at the lava lounge .   it ' s a nice little bar ,  cool decor ,  comfy couches ,  great djs .   but be careful about opening a tab .  .  . four of us had $120 .  tab in an hour ,  a little ridiculous ! 
__label__4 lava lounge is a great low key bar in tremont .  i was expecting a little bit more before i went for a night out .  we sat at the bar and the bartenders were great !  they were playing a rockin '  playlist too ,  which was very enjoyable .  the food was great too .    it is nice to be able to out in tremont and not spend a ton of money .  they were very reasonably priced ! 
__label__4 don ' t sit by the door in the winter !  other than that it ' s pretty good food and atmosphere . 
__label__4 i like this place a lot .   on the weekends i work at another restaurant in the area .   this place is close enough to walk to after i ' m done .   i have a feeling going that is going to be a tradition .   the bar tenders were great ,  the drinks good  ( albeit a little pricey )  .   the pommes frites were good .   sweet potatoes dipped in tempure batter and served with garlic aoli .   they were great . 
__label__3 the lava lounge is a fun destination -- hipster lounge meets corner dive .  our party of four arrived during happy hour and enjoyed some yummy ,  offbeat $5 . 00 martinis ,  like pineapple  bomb and rocket pop .   we also ordered apps and burgers; they were all delish -- this place would rate four stars except for the piece of paper embedded in our apple cobbler dessert . 
__label__5 awesome place for just dinner and / or drinks !  best chicken sandwich ever !  had a great party in the upstairs .  i was totally pleased as i am every time i come here !  service is great ! 
__label__4 props to lava lounge for offering up the upstairs to a group of drunk yelpers on saturday night .    i think i may have almost passed out on the comfy couch .  and definitely had a hard time making it up  /  down the stairs .  if you helped me ,  thank you ! 
__label__3 this place definitely screams after-hours bar .   i went with a friend to have post work dinner and drinks .   the chicken satay was overcooked and dry ,  and the accompanying peanut sauce was runny .   the chicken had a good flavor but still .  .  .  bar service is good .   very dark in there . 
__label__5 every time i come here ,  i want to branch out and try somehting new ,  but the corned beef is just so good i can ' t !  this is my favorite corned beef ,  and that includes between all of cleveland ,  cincinnati ,  and even i hate to say ,  chicago .  the key is that if you order the hot reuben ,  it is buttered and grilled ,  with fresh thousand island and mild sauerkraut .  for people with more of a love for an intense kraut ,  this is not the place ,  but the size of the sandwich meets the price tag you pay .    they also have typical diner breakfasts and favorites .   the limitation s really mainly the hours ,  they are only open for breakfast and lunch ,  which is probably for the best ,  i would eat here all the time if i could ! 
__label__5 great food !  amazing service .  everyone is pleasant and accommodating . 
__label__5 i found this restaurant on foodnetwork . com and they did not disappoint .  the pastrami mad corned beef combo was outstanding !  the service was even better ,  friendly and courteous .  i ' m not often in cleveland but when i return i will be going right back to danny ' s deli . 
__label__4 i don ' t think you can miss here to be honest .  i ' ve gone here for breakfast several times and always got the breakfast burrito ,  which is really good .  they put the hashbrowns inside which is never a bad idea .  as much as i hate to admit it ,  i ' ve had breakfast here and ordered sandwiches to take home for later .  they ' re that good .  i like the lunches better than breakfast .  corned beef ,  pastrami .  .  . you name it ,  they ' re all great .  the new yorker is my favorite because it ' s loaded with meat and cole slaw .    it ' s a small place ,  but great people and great service .  you go there twice and they ' ll remember you for life .  there are regulars everywhere which always says something . 
__label__5 was looking for lunch after a visit to the rock  ' n toll hall of fame .  danny ' s came up on yelp and was an easy walk .  the place was hopping but seemed to be organized chaos .  our waitress was busy so danny took care of us .  very attentive .  our hot pastrami sandwich was hot ,  piled high and tasty .  would return in a heartbeat . 
__label__2 nothing to write home about .   don ' t expect anything healthy on the menu .   salads are out of the 50s - iceberg lettuce .   at best ,  you can consider it pub food .   after a few pints ,  you ' ll be satisfied with the food .   small selection .   another terminal has the great lakes brewing company and they have an expansive menu with all sorts of options to tempt your taste buds . 
__label__5 love this place ,  this is the vibe  a music venue should ooze .  good beer selection ,  very affordable ,  good service and great shows ,  enough said .  if your the type of person who prefers to sit while watching shows this is not the place for your old huxtable ass . 
__label__4 great bands .  cheap drinks .  people having fun .  what could be better ? 
__label__5  .  .  .  . do yourself a favor ,  come on in and order and straub .  .  . then tell  ' em dejockomo mcgankaweitz sent  ' ya !  !  arrrrrr
__label__5 great place !  !  cool layout ,  interesting art ,  arcade machines ,  good beer ,  nice staff .  free amateur comedy show on mondays at 9pm .  cool bands come and play there .  i ' ll def be back when i ' m in the cleve ! 
__label__4 every once in a while we come to check out a live band ,  last show i saw was dmc  ( yes minus reverend run )  .  bar staff is attentive ,  free iced water that you can get yourself .  bathrooms are covered in graffiti but entertaining to read while making wee wee .  lots of dancing room .  for short people like myself i was still able to see the performers easy . 
__label__5 the draft  /  avail playing to a nearly packed house at the grog .  everyone singing along to "model" and "belief ' s pile" .  glorious .    hot water music kicking through the jams on their final  (  !  ?  )  tour .  hearing chris wollard ,  after a dozen beers ,  call everyone a "turkey" .  five guys in the back of the room responded by gobbling loudly .    captured !  by robots doing a full tribute to star trek: the next generation ,  complete with projector screen and starfleet uniforms for all the  ' bots .    some really hot girl grabbing my ass .  when i turned around ,  she just smirked ,  batted her eyes ,  and then ran off to join her friends .  never saw her again ,  but felt like a million bucks .    with the exception of feeling like the oldest man on earth when i showed up to interview anti-flag amidst an ocean of 13-year olds ,  the grog is nothing but wonderful memories .    looking forward to seeing my buddy chuck play there on jan .  29th . 
__label__4 my favorite place in cleveland to see bands .   though i do have to say i miss the old arabica .  . and the old grog .   they should combine the two .   that would be stellar .  irish coffees for all . 
__label__5 we visited edwins last evening and had a spectacular time .   quite simply - it is by far the best restaurant in shaker square  ( and there are a few very nice spots )  but the place also serves a great mission .    ( it ' s been discussed many times so i won ' t get back into it )  .   but the food ,  the service ,  the surroundings ,  the owner and the entire team were all top notch .   this place is a must go and is now our fine dining ,  stop in for a nice cocktail or after movie desert place . 
__label__3 love that the restaurant hires a lot of previously incarcerated individuals .  the atmosphere was good but the food was hit or miss .  the salted duck was okay but the risotto was amazing .  i ' m not sure that i would come again . 
__label__5 all three of us were 100% full ,  satisfied ,  and blown away by the quality of the service ,  ambiance ,  and food .    the staff: check out the website .  this is so much more than your typical restaurant .  their institute is ,  or nearly is ,  one of a kind .  everyone was friendly ,  prompt ,  and knowledgeable .    the food: the cocktail list had a wide variety and their wine closet was quite robust  ( pretty to look at too )  .  i had the apple bourbon - appropriate for the season .  rather than choose one item ,  we decided to share several smaller dishes like tapas .  many fancy-shmancy places discourage this ,  but our server was perfectly accommodating and even asked if we had a preference for the order of the dishes .  we ended up trying three dishes that we ' d never had: escargot ,  oysters ,  and frog legs - go big or go home ,  right ?  all three were divine !  !  granted enough butter and garlic can make anything tasty ,  but this was so much more .  it was simple yet delicious ,  light yet filling ,  new but still had an aire of comfort food .  we also had soup ,  salad ,  and shared two desserts - one of which  ( banana foster )  was cooked tableside for an added pzazz .   the price: it isn ' t cheap or even a regular date night stop .  it ' s a fancy ,  we are celebrating something important ,  kind of place .  but entire check is tax-deductible - check out the website to learn about the institute .  we got to eat amazing food that i could never in 1million years cook ,  and help our local community ,  yup !  i ' m all in and will go back for our next celebration . 
__label__3 my boyfriend and i had dinner for valentine ' s day .  the restaurant had a great ambiance ,  romantic and enjoyed the piano at dinner .  the food was ok ,  nothing like what i expected from reading other reviews .  i had the duck confit ,  which was super salty couldn ' t eat much of it .  my boyfriend had the filet mignon ,  which was soft ,  cooked to order but lacked much flavor and was very small .  i have to say dessert probably was the best part of dinner .  we had the banana foster prepared at the tableside ,  which was enjoyable to see and tasted pretty good too .  overall ,  food was ok ,  dessert was good and service was great other than our waiter couldn ' t tell us soup of the day . 
__label__5 getting stranded in cleveland by the airline was not on my list of things to do the day i was there ,  but the airline found us a discounted rate at the marriott ,  which is where this hotel is located .  the shuttle driver was super friendly and informed us that out of the 343 marriott restaurants ,  this one is ranked 4th .  um ,  ok ,  really ?  i was having a hard time believing him ,  but i was tired so i went with it .  low and behold ,  that guy was right .  the food was wonderful ,  farm to table and everything else you would want your meal to be .  the server was super helpful ,  let me sample the wine before i chose it and made deciding on what to get easy .  i went with the seared scallops with risotto and butternut squash and was not disappointed .  the squash is enough for two people !  i ended with the date cake and it was perfect .  by the end of the meal ,  i was almost happy that i got stuck in cleveland so i had the opportunity to try this little gem . 
__label__4 what a hidden gem ,  in a hotel away from all the action of cleveland .  i have had the six course tasting menu twice now and what a bargain at $50 per person .  they also have a four course tasting menu for $35 per person .  the menu itself is pretty reasonable for the quality of food you get .  i have not had anything that i didn ' t like with most of the food being outstanding ,  5 out 5 stars on food .  some of the highlights that i have had are the light and foamy velvet mushroom bisque with truffle oil ,  edamame falafel ,  braised lamb ,  fried pork belly with hoisin glaze and pan seared bronzini with sunchoke puree .  they have a very large domestic  beer selection with some great midwest finds .  the wine list is adequate but not great .  service has always been very good ,  with attentive  knowledgeable servers .  the downside of the restaurant is its location i ' m sure it would be busier if the location was different .  some of the things i don ' t care for is that you may have to park some distances away from the front door if the hotel is full and the atmosphere ,  you feel pretty much like you are eating in a lobby of a hotel .  i think a upgrade on the server uniform would not hurt either . 
__label__4 amp 150 has been a favorite of mine for awhile .  we often go there when we want a nice meal but don ' t feel like going to one of the trendy neighborhoods in town .   they do not have many vegetarian options ,  but what they do have is delicious .   i"  my favorite is the chopped salad ,  which is large enough to be a meal itself .   the dressing is divine  ( white balsamic i believe )  and they put it in perfectly ,  not too much not too little .   i learned the value of avocado in a salad after having this salad a few years ago !   the saltiness of the kalamata olives blends in perfectly with your other salad staples - carrots ,  grape tomatoes ,  romaine lettuce .   i ' ve also enjoyed the cauliflower goat cheese side dish in the past and the tomato soup .   at my last visit ,  i got the ricotta gnocci with kale and beets .   i have recently learned that i love beets ,  and i always try to like kale .   i didn ' t have to try hard this time - the bitterness that generally accompanies kale was completely gone .  the ricotta gnocci was like biting into a pasta pillow .   the restaurant itself is strange because it opens up into the lobby of the marriott .   it feels like you ' re dining in the middle of a hotel if you ' re not seated in the back .  however ,  it ' s also generally much quieter than other restaurants since it ' s not in the busier restaurant districts . 
__label__5 yes ,  this restaurant is in a hotel ,  a marriott hotel ,  but don ' t let that sway your opinion in the least bit .    there is nothing about amp 150 that makes you think run of the mill hotel restaurant .   amp goes way beyond bar food and provides you with a great and ever changing seasonal menu utilizing only that which is fresh .   nothing in their restaurant comes out of a can or box .  in the summer they even have a garden out back from which they harvest  most of the vegetables they use in their dishes at that time .  i ' ve been to amp 150 well over a dozen times whether it was a drink and a bite to eat at the bar waiting before picking a friend up at the airport or a dinner in their private dining room the food is always outstanding .   since the menu changes on a very regular basis i won ' t bother giving you specific menu recommendations because that will only leave you disappointed if they aren ' t on the menu .   so what do i suggest you order then you might ask ?  the chef ' s tasting .   amp offers a 4 and 6 course tasting menu chosen by the chef .   they do however let you give some input if you must but i suggest let the chef surprise you .   every time i ' ve done the chef ' s tasting i always feel i ' m getting the best of the best based on what ' s in season .    if you are slightly less adventurous ,  i ' d suggest giving a try to the appetizer and soup sections along with the small plates .   that ' s not to say their large plates aren ' t good but i tend to prefer variety to quantity .   the small plates just allow you to try two different dishes of good portion size at the same price as one of the larger plates .   they have a nice variety in the appetizer section and the soups always taste as fresh as the vegetables in them .   as far as the desserts go ,  i ' d highly suggest saving room .   while they change as often as the regular menu it always keeps me trying something new and more often then not i ' m happy with it .  the other nice thing about amp 150 is their beer selection .   they have a fairly extensive beer selection and while not the best in the city it is much better than most restaurants .  my only complaint about amp 150 would be the service .  while the experiences are not always bad ,  i have had some less than stellar service from time to time but it doesn ' t stop me from going and it shouldn ' t stop you from trying it .  after all ,  really good food can make up for just about anything in my book and chef ellis cooley has come through every time .  in closing ,  if you haven ' t been to amp 150 yet ,  you must go .  not next month ,  tomorrow .  it is what i ' d consider one of the top 10 restaurants in cleveland and the best food for the value for sure . 
__label__5 wowza .  i have been to amp 150 a handful of times now ,  and it never ,  ever disappoints .    located inside the airport marriott ,  amp 150 is worth the journey ,  whether you stay at the hotel or not .  to begin ,  the food is just good .  g-o-o-d .  farm-to-table concepts can get lost on me sometimes ,  but i can taste the difference here .  its so clear amp 150 cares deeply about their menu and the quality of their food .   the seating in the restaurant is open concept with a very modern vibe .  they have small rooms to accommodate larger reservations ,  booths that can physically turn directions ,  and plentiful tables .  they also have a full bar ,  and even infuse their own vodkas in house .  the cocktail menu is so inventive and fun ,  and just to forewarn ,  you ' ll want one of everything .    amp 150 might have the best panna cotta in cleveland .  the portion is huge and served in a deep glass .  the flavor is so rich and fluffy with a sweet caramel undertone ,  and i ' m pretty sure its what dreams are made of .  everything on the menu is excellent ,  and i also recommend getting several appetizers to share  ( the fried brussel sprouts and roasted cauliflower really stand out )  .  everyone can find a menu choice they ' ll love ,  and amp 100% lives up their motto: america ' s modern palate . 
__label__4 does amp 150 have an identity crisis ?  is it a .  )  a hotel restaurant ,  b .  )  a beer lover ' s paradise c .  )  a foodie destination .  .  .  .  . the correct answer is d .  )  all of the above .    3 couples descended upon amp 150 on saturday night to see if there really was a quality restaurant in the airport marriott .  there were many skeptics among us .   atmosphere:  keep in mind that you are entering a hotel and with that ,  you are always going to see all types of people .  there was a class reunion going on in the banquet area of the hotel and there must have been a hockey tournament in town as well due to the oversized bags and kids everywhere .  we slowly approached the bar area and had to ask if this was amp 150 or not .  the nice bartender informed us that ,  yes ,  we were in the right place and that she could take our order .  for those that remember jack ' s at this location ,  burn it out of your memory ,  it ' s gone .  the whole restaurant is open to the lobby ,  which might confuse people when they ' re looking for amp 150  bar: the bartender was nice ,  although she needs some education around the long beer list that ' s offered .   it was good to see some of the normal suspects ,  glbc & flying dog on the menu ,  but it was also a pleasant surprise to see some more unique beers listed .  the beer offering is outstanding and rather large .  if you like beer ,  you ' ll definitely like their list and be able to find something you like .  their "house" drinks were also the rave of the ladies in attendance .  the manager was kind enough to offer them a few samples; among them was the bloody mary ,  which was fabulous .  they are making all of their own mixers and the quality of the ingredients shows .   food: as a group we decided that we ' d order up a few appetizers and split them amongst us .  we tasted the flat bread ,  oyster mushroom appetizer ,  pig feet tamale ,  & tamarind pork belly .  yes ,  these were all appetizers offered in a "hotel restaurant" all appetizers were very tasty and unique .  the mixed green salad and chicken soup were also ordered .   the soup came out just a little on the chilly side ,  but the taste overrode the temperature .  the mixed green salad i was told was also well prepared and very good .  for main courses ,  we again tried to spread out and cover the menu ,  skirt steak ,  pork chop schnitzel ,  rigatoncini ,  and beef tenderloin were all tried .  again a temperature issue arose with a few of the items ,  but nothing to overpower the overall taste of the item .  my guess is that they are still trying to get the timing down on some of the items and some may have sat a little longer than they intended .   we weren ' t done yet ,  dessert was ordered .  we ordered the milk chocolate pana cotta and the warm chocolate cake .  the pana cotta was by far the big winner here .   the warm chocolate cake was good ,  but the creaminess of the pana cotta far outweighed the moistness of the cake .    service:  service was very good ,  but i ' m not sure if this was because she was attentive or if it was due to the lack of patrons .  water glasses were always full and she stopped back multiple times during and between courses to make sure that the meal was moving along at the right pace .  it was .     price:  we decided that we ' d split the bill amongst the 3 couples ,  the grand total per couple was $120 ,  inclusive of tax + tip and alcohol .  every person at the table had at least two drinks at the table .   an excellent meal for a good value .  check it out if you get the chance .   overall:  would we go again ?  sure ,  although i do have some recommendations .  save spaces out front or offer valet service for restaurant patrons ,  as i stated there was a reunion in the hotel that night and parking was at a premium ,  we therefore had to enter from the back parking lot and work our way through the reunion crowd .  kick the kids away from the bar ,  if you are trying to be a little more than a hotel restaurant ,  act like it . 
__label__5 this is my second visit in one day .  this place is amazing and our server is extremely attentive to our needs .  thank you susan for your excellent service . 
__label__4 i find it hilarious that abc is located smack dab the middle of the "newest ,  trendiest" part of town - and it does not give a shit .  it ' s a dark dingy-dive that is slinging juicy burgs and that ' s all there is too it .     we heard that this unassuming place had some of the best burgers in town - as far as classic burgers go - and it did not disappoint .  i also loved that they had hand cut fries !    cheap .  delicious .  don ' t miss this spot for your late night burger craving . 
__label__1 once the abc was revamped and remodeled ,  we loved it .  .  .  it was a fun little spot with decent service and with an overall good vibe .   that quickly changed on one night .  .  .  long story short ,  someone slipped stuff into drinks .  .  .  and thankfully knowing i was not feeling well ,  i took a cab home .  .  .    ladies ,  beware if you are in this place and if you are there ,  guard your drinks like a hawk !   you can have a much better and safer experience elsewhere . 
__label__4 sometimes you wanna go .  .  .  where everybody knows your name .  .  .  .   this is that neighborhood joint that anyone is welcome .  you ' re bound to find business people ,  hipsters ,  and college kids on any given night at the same time .  prices are right - and the food is amazing .  in fact ,  you would never expect food in such an obscure place to taste so good - but its a dream for a foodie like me .    don ' t let the outside of abc fool you .  this is the place you want to be seen . 
__label__4 it does have a bit of a sanitized dive bar feel that i think does come off a bit pretentious but it ' s cheap ,  the small menu is decent  ( with vegetarian options too )  ,  and the staff are great . 
__label__5 had the veggie naan-wich here on a walnut wednesday and wow .  it was amazing .  that naan bread .  .  .  need to try it out again sometime . 
__label__4 after sampling several brews at the international beer fest yesterday afternoon ,  i was left heavily intoxicated and ridiculously hungry .   thankfully for me ,  the perfect comfort food awaited at streat mobile bistro .   blurry-eyed ,  i still managed to make out the words "mac & cheese" for a price of $6 on their menu and ordered immediately .  service was super friendly and fast - plus ,  they take credit card .    as for that mac & cheese .   .   . it was absolutely everything i ever wanted at that very moment .   ooh ,  and the panko was a very nice touch .  basically ,  i devoured within minutes ,  maybe seconds even . 
__label__5 it ' s a shame there are only 5 stars to give .  jay and izzy brought the truck and their crew and catered our wedding .  nothing short of fantastic !  the least positive feedback i ' ve heard from our 200+ guests was  ' amazing '  .  no kidding .  our crowd ranged in age from 21 to 85 and was very diverse ,  culturally as well as economically .  not an easy task to make all of them happy at the same time .  and i mean all of them .  there ' s always those people that complain about something or other ,  right ?  the ones you can never make happy ,  or the ones that tell you it was ok ,  but would have been better if you ' d only done something different .  you know who i mean .  not at our wedding .  what makes it even better was the guests were telling us as we walked around how much they were enjoying the food !  we didn ' t ask them .  they told us ,  unsolicited and have continued to do so the entire week after the event .  the conversations went pretty much like this .  .  .  ' congratulations you guys .  we ' re so happy for you .  oh my god the food is incredible !  '  .   again .  .  . not kidding .  the food was unique ,  plentiful ,  delicious ,  and beautifully presented and maintained throughout the entire course of the evening and the staff was almost invisible but everything was always perfect .  i ' ve worked in food for 35 and a few years ,  and spent a good number of those catering large venue and off premise sites with one of the largest and most reputable catering companies in northeast ohio .   i understand what they did and appreciate the logistics and obstacles they were faced with and i can ' t give high enough praise to the execution and presentation .  the site our reception actually happened at was the 4th site we ' d moved to .  our original venue was shut down 4 months prior to our wedding and then we had 3 more site changes in the month prior to our date .  where we landed was not an easy place for a caterer to work .  they had a 6 ft wide access corridor behind the space that was a 30 yard walk to where they were able to park the truck .  so they could set up one small prep table ,  a third of a football field from their kitchen and that ' s how they serviced a party for 215 people ,  and it was flawless .  i also want to mention that all along the way ,  as we were constantly having to change sites for one reason or another and going through unimaginable stress as we were got closer and closer to our date ,  izzy was consistently calming and reassuring and made us feel like our wedding would be perfect .  nothing takes the place of dealing with pros .   both izzy ,  and jay never made us feel like we had anything but the best working for us ,  and when it came down to walking the walk ,  they did a job that made us proud and would have made kings and presidents proud as well .  we can ' t thank them enough ,  or recommend them highly enough . 
__label__3 went here for an early dinner ,  despite reading yelp reviews ,  and wasn ' t too amazed nor too disappointed .   the main problem i read about was the servers .  however ,  when we went ,  the servers seemed like they were trying to correct that image .  so anything that went wrong was fixed fast and when they forgot to give us snow crab initially ,  they gave us an extra pound of crawfish .  it just seems like the employees aren ' t completely used to the restaurant feel yet .    the food was pretty good ,  not crazy .  be sure to get at least medium because the spice takes the food over the edge .  don ' t bother with the crawfish .  they ' re small and don ' t have a lot of meat .  that said ,  the snow crab was pretty incredible .    i probably wouldn ' t go back ,  but i didn ' t hate it .  i feel like they just need a little more time to perfect their place . 
__label__5 i live near shaker square and have eaten at edwin ' s 3 times .   every visit was excellant .   the food ,  service and alcohol are all excellant .   last night they served me the best halibut i ever had .   the preparation was just great and the fish was positively suculent .   i needed extra bread to sop up every delicious drop of sauce that came on the fish .   i love to eat there . 
__label__5 phenomenal french bistro which also helps felons become productive citizens again .  expensive ,  but worth it ! 
__label__5 i loved edwin ' s "education-wins . "   the decor has only a few relatively minor changes from the previous occupants .   the newly draped windows adds warmth ,  privacy and an air of exclusivity .   it also hides the scores of diners that maybe inside .   on our second visit we found the seating area around the fireplace both cozy & sexy ,  a nice change to sitting at the bar for a late night cocktail .     the food was on point ,  my salmon was perfectly cooked on top of refreshing bed of cucumbers .   the staff was pleasant ,  plentiful ,  professional and attentive .   brandon rocks !   so the draw backs ?  take your reading glasses the menu print is small & the darkness makes reading it impossible ,  so we went with the staff ' s recommendations & was not disappointed . 
__label__4 outstanding cooking ,  everything fresh ,  nice staff ,  very interesting selection of imported italian groceries ,  excellent baked goods ,  too .   this is a grocery and deli ,  with prepared foods they make themselves .   no on-premise dining . 
__label__5 i really enjoy coming here .  .  .  sure it ' s slightly more expensive than other asian groceries in the area ,   but it is definitely the place to get the korean grocery items you seek .  i certainly wouldn ' t do all my shopping here ,   i don ' t think anyone would .  the storefront is small and really more of a niche shop that a true grocery store ,   but you can certainly find any specifically culturally korean items you need here .  many things that i am not able to find at larger asian grocery stores they have here; korean rice cakes ,   perilla leaves ,  sea kelp ,  yogurt drinks ,  korean brand instant noodles and snacks .  .  .  literally anything you would need to make a korean recipe they have .  there is a small cooler in the corner next to the register ,  the first few times i went in here in ever even noticed it ,  but they do sell some produce and even fish out of here as well .  even if you ' re looking for korean style tools and cooking accessories ,   they have it !  i ' ve usually had pretty decent service here ,   not overly friendly ,   but what asian grocery is ,  really ?  they have helped me find some specific items though ,   and i ' m always seeing  new stuff when i come in .  would definitely recommend for anyone looking for korean grocery items ! 
__label__4 love it .  stick with small plates .  suggest chicken soup and mussels .  seasonal changes are always good .  pork belly- wow .  the salads are always great too . 
__label__4 i am giving my review an extra star solely for the service i received from stephanie ,  the hostess and the busser on 12 / 3 / 2013 .   not only were they attentive but they were very sweet and extremely hospitable .    i only had the apple salad and the hand cut fries so i can ' t say how excellent the cooking skills are but both dishes were tasty and hit the spot . 
__label__2 pork chop as under cooked ,  very pink inside .  had to send it back .  when they brought it back to me ,  it appeared to have been placed in a microwave to finish cooking but it was still pink in the middle .  the server told me it ' s ok now days to have pork pink .  needless  to say ,  i could not eat the under cooked pork so i ordered a dessert .  servers were nice and attentive . 
__label__4 rating based on its location and surrounding restaurants in the area ,  which were far less appetizing .  this is definitely a gem in the area .  definitely a must try if you want some great food in ohio !  this is what we ordered: pate mushroom soup beet salad scallops striped bass sauteed squash
__label__3 the menu is extensive and have some great options !  the food taste is ok !  for this type of restaurant i was expecting a lot more .  i am not saying it is bad ,  it is not that at all ,  but in comparison to other upscale restaurants that i have been to ,  this one is on the low end .  i had the chicken soup ,  the papardelle pasta and the pana cotta .  the soup and the pasta came in at the exact same time ,  which was kind of disappointing .  they took it back to the kitchen but i am sure it was sitting on a heat lamp until i was done with the appetizer .  the pasta tasted great ,  fresh ingredients ,  fresh pasta .  the pana cotta was disappointing .  service also lacked in quality too ,  although it was friendly ,  it could have been more efficient . 
__label__2 overpriced and very little flavor .  portion sizes are also extremely small .  the only thing i enjoyed was their salad .   during my stay i had salmon  ( $22 )  and half roasted chicken  ( 22 )  .  the salmon was decent but the chicken has no flavoring and the plate was speared with what tasted like my son ' s baby food squash .  do not recommend ! 
__label__2 what ' s that smell ?   i ended up at amp 150 ,  in the lobby of the airport marriott not by chance ,  but by necessity .  most of the hotels were full downtown and i elected to stay here .   i was headed out to some irish pub that i found on yelp when the staff at this buzzing ,  open-air bar / restaurant showed me tonight ' s menu .   even the chef came over and gave personal recommendations .  .  .  . what the heck .  .  . i ' ll eat here tonight .  .  .  . no driving ,  no waiting .   the beer selection is decent .    i went with a a german pils called six point .  .  . 5 . 2 and smooth .   good start .   then i smelled it .    good god ,  whats that smell ?   a mixture of sewer gas and stale beer .   it passed and i hoped it was from the large table behind me .   i ordered the seafood bouillabaisse .  .  . recommended by the chef .   very tomatoey .  .  . very nice .   i devoured this yummy dish and ordered my third beer .   then the smell again .   damn .   it ' s bad now .   why does it smell so bad ?   houston ,  we have a problem .   i was just trying to get through this meal and head back up to my room .   the beer was cold ,  the meal was good .  .  . the smell in this area .  .  . next to the bar .  .  .  . unbearable . 
__label__4 if you can get over the location this is a great place .   if tremont has become the litmus of trendy places to go ,  this establishment would feel right at home in there .   the menu is very creative .   i have tried many of the dishes and everything is done with a level of creativity that doesn ' t overwhelm the dish but enhances it .   looking back at it ,  this is one of the more creative restaurants in cleveland .   shrimp and grits is a must !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !   flatbread can be boring and predictable but the mushroom one is decadent .   now to take care of that hotel thingy .  .  . 
__label__4 i ' ve been here a million times ,  so i ' m surprised that i haven ' t reviewed it .    as a fag hag ,  i enjoy that there ' s a diverse crowd of people at bounce / union station .  whether you ' re gay ,  straight ,  or anything in-between ,  there ' s a place for you at bounce .    i particularly enjoy the drag shows on the weekends .  saturday night is lesbian night and features a couple drag kings ,  too  ( and nearly naked female go go dancers ,  if you ' re into that sort of thing )  .    maybe i ' m getting to be an old lady ,  but the crowd seems to be getting younger and younger at bounce .  maybe because it ' s more of a dance club ?  so if you ' re looking for a place to watch an amazing show or to shake it ,  this is the place for you .  if you want a nice chill place to spend the evening ,  look elsewhere . 
__label__2 if you want to see every stereotype of gay men displayed in front of you ,  go to bounce .  i guess some so called  ' fag hags '  enjoy these public displays of obnoxiousness ,  but as a grown man ,  i feel i ' ve endured more than enough of them .  the crowd is usually a combination of twinky club kidz and lesbians .  allegedly drugs are a problem here ,  although i have never seen any .  the stalls in the men ' s room have no doors  ( get the picture ?  )  .  if this is your kinda place ,  have a blast . 
__label__3 my friend wanted to check out coventry last weekend .  so we did .  we ended up going in this place .  does everyone on the eastside wear those nerd frame glasses like paul pfeifer from the wonder years ?  even the chicks did .  either way ,  i started talking to a really sweet girl from west virginia .  i asked her if she knew who the dancing outlaw jesco white is ,  she said "yeah ,  he is a friend of the family .  he is from boone county though .  i think he gives west virginians a bad name . " i couldn ' t have disagreed with her anymore .  that really made my night and probably changed my opinion on the place .  in all reality ,  it is probably a two star bar . 
__label__4 had a great dinner here on saturday night .  my favorites were the fries and the hawaiian roll .  the salt and pepper mackerel was very good ,  and the five mushroom tofu was excellent .  scott kim runs a very nice restaurant ,  and we look forward to going there again soon ! 
__label__5 love this place .  great atmosphere ,  friendly greeting at the door ,  and a relaxing bar .  we had a cocktail before dinner and never felt rushed .  even offered an appetizer at the bar pre dinner .    sat down and were immediately attended to both with water and our server ready to take drink orders .  i knew this server from other visits and she was extremely helpful and made suggestions for sake based on my previous visits .    sasa fries were perfect as usual .  this is an updated menu but we were able to do a bunch of different plates still .  the rock is a must and the ribs  ( 3 varieties including lamb )  were great .  the cod katsu was awesome !  !  !  !  !   i ' ll keep coming back as this is one of the best locations in shaker square .  i ' ll get the katsu for sure . 
__label__5 i ' ve been going out to eat at sasa ever since i could drive in high school .  i love sushi and japanese cuisine and sasa is one of my favorites for a couple different reasons .  it is not the most gourmet or high class but i love the atmosphere ,  the style in which they cook and serve their dishes ,  and food quality and creativity are of the highest caliber .    sasa has a young slightly hipster vibe as the bar is clearly a centerpiece in the low light .  the tables are simple and minimal and allow u to focus on your food and company .  the sushi rolls alone are enough to make a trip to sasa ,  however i highly recommend starting off with some nagiri or sashimi to start .  everything is played beautifully and tastes delicious .  there are so many different flavored and unique tastes to try .  the only complaint i ' ve ever really had is i wish more of their menu was spicy .    all said and done sasa is not fine dining but it is on the classier end of sushi .  if your looking for a fun night out where you can enjoy a nice atmosphere without braking your wallet  ( or the $100 mark )  then i highly recommend a night out at sasa . 
__label__2 for being a sushi place the sushi here was pretty disappointing .  we tried three of the specialty rolls .  .  . fish was too fishy and not very fresh and the rolls fell apart while eating them .   and each roll was $15ish  pros: service was great .  decor adorable and the small plates were pretty decent .   would not come back here for the sushi tho . 
__label__3 i was in the shaker square area during happy hour and thought that i would drop by sasa and give their offerings a try .    i went on a tuesday afternoon and it was pretty empty upon arriving at approx 5:00 ,  just 3-4 other people .    i ordered the cosmopolitan ,  sasa fries and the lamb sliders .   the cosmo ,  was just ok and the fries and sliders were pretty good .    i ' m not sure that sasa would be my go-to restaurant .    the staff was too laid back for my taste .   there were lots of huddled conversations going on and also snacking in plain view of the customers .   the lamb sliders were well seasoned and topped with kimchi and served on bakery fresh buns .    the fries were also well seasoned ,  battered and then fried until crispy and golden ,  served with 2 dipping sauces .     the food   ( 4 stars )  was definitely much better than the service  ( 2 stars )  . 
__label__5 sasa is always on point .  some of the best sushi in town ,  phenomenal ramen ,  and deliciously authentic small plates .  if you haven ' t had them ,  sasa fries are game changers . 
__label__3 ordered a sushi online which i have spent about $70 but two a la carte nigiri was missing so i had to call them back .  they took an hour to get those two sushi delivered .  and the sushi was delivered squeezed and delivering guy was giving me a uncomfortable look .  not worth a $70 cuz portion was not quite much . 
__label__4 so here is the down low ,  i am a first time home owner but i am not a handy woman ,  so when my a / c wasn ' t working right i had no clue what to do .  i didn ' t even know where the filter was .  i called around to a couple places and was met with businesses who made me feel like an inconvenience for asking questions or ones who wanted to charge me an extra $40 for them having to use a ladder .  there was also a place with an f rating with the bbb .  least to say i was definitely not feeling comfortable with what i was finding .    then i got this advertisement in the mail for btu comfort solutions .  they were offering a cleaning or diagnostic service for $69 so i decided to give them a call and see if they were going to try and bamboozle me as well .  i spoke with ann who was immediately pleasant and friendly ,  she did not try and rush me off the phone ,  instead she patiently explained the services they offer ,  answered all of my questions ,  and even told me she ' d have one of the service techs explain everything in detail to me since i confessed i was pretty ignorant about the a / c .  something else that was great ?  their price was their price .  they weren ' t going to charge me $95 for 30 minutes then $90 an hour after that like some other companies .  there were no extra costs unless i needed products like more coolant  ( freon )  .  they also had evening hours  ( 5-7pm )  and had a spot open for the very next day !    day of there was an issue with my appointment time being delayed due to a longer work time at the appointment before mine and a lack of communication between the tech ,  the office ,  and me .  so i was a bit frustrated in being hot ,  sweaty ,  and not knowing what was going on .  i got a hold of peter ,  the owner ,  and he sincerely apologized and explained what had happened .  this was a fluke and did not represent how they normally do their business .  christian ,  the tech ,  finally showed up and did a thorough job of checking out my a / c unit ,  showing me where the filter was ,  and explaining everything that he was doing .  turns out my circuit breaker was not switched on and that was the problem .   ( i know ,  i know ,  i feel silly ,  but in my defense how was i supposed to know the previous homeowners turned it off ?  i know ,  still not a good excuse .  .  .  )  .   ann called me the next morning to further apologize and to offer me a comp towards a service if i still wanted one .  i declined since everything worked out in the end and my a / c was just fine .  i even told her that because of how they handled things i would be using their company again in the fall for a yearly check-up of my furnace .  mistakes happen ,  what was important to me was that btu seemed to be genuine from the start .  they recognized their error ,  they still had their tech check out my a / c unit even though it was getting pretty late ,  they sincerely apologized ,  they didn ' t charge me ,  staff was educated on the importance of communicating ,  and they even offered a comp towards a future service !  good job btu !  you ' re alright in my book . 
__label__1 food was incredibly disappointing and when we sent a dish back ,  the manager came to our table and accused us !  !  !  !  unbelievable !  we were so mad that we left right away  even though we hardly ate at all and was still hungry .  portions are tiny and ordering a sushi roll + an appetizer and a beer cost us $40 !    we had ordered sasa fire roll ,  which was good ,  and then salt and pepper mackerel which came out lukewarm and shrimp yaki-udon was terrible !  first of all ,  the portion size was incredibly small .  we were surprised as this was a main course .  the dish was extremely salty as the noodles were soaked in sauce ,  which is not how a stir-fry noodle dish should be .  when we sent it back to the kitchen and wanted to order something else instead ,  manager came to our table and first thing she said that because we had ate half the plate ,  she was going to charge us for it .  absolutely ridiculous !  portions are so small that even the manager though we had ate half of it !  hah !  we had only tasted it and we immediately sent it back .  next she told us that the dish had too much sauce because we wanted to change the shrimp  ( food allergy )  to chicken .  that makes no sense ,  the problem was simply the dish was too salty because there was way too much sauce !  she continued to imply it was our fault and she would have to inform the chef and "see what can be done about it" instead of apologizing for the terrible food .    we will never be back again .  a restaurant should know how important good service is ,  and the way sasa ' s manager handled the situation tonight was just incredibly rude .  i will not recommend anyone to come here for the mediocre food . 
__label__2 made an online reservation for a birthday and even mentioned it during dinner and it was ignored .  waitress was not very responsive and seem to have an attitude .  ordered a mackerel entree and received what seemed like half a very small fish .  was hoping to be getting an entree not a piece of sushi .  sushi was good .  overall would not go back .  was not busy . 
__label__4 it was a pleasure eating at sasa matsu .  my service was wonderful and the menu adventurous .   while sasa offers a full sushi selection ,  the focus is on their tapas-style dishes organized as small ,  medium ,  and large on the menu .  i highly recommend the scallops  ( medium )  .  i also tried "the rock" which was fun -- slivers of marinaded beef tenderloin are served with a hot rock for cooking .   the decor was simple and trendy with a few asian accents . 
__label__4 first time dining here ,  and my only regret is not having been here sooner !  this is a really trendy japanese restaurant right next to the shaker square cinema ,  which makes it a convenient location for a pre / post-movie dinner .  you can make reservations through opentable on their website ,  and parking is free if you park in the lot behind the theatre and daves market .   i went here with a friend for a pre-movie dinner ,  and for drinks ,  we ordered the traditional sake tasting  ( $10 - great deal !  )  of 5 different cold sake ,  ranging from very dry to very sweet .  i ' m no sake expert ,  but it was a neat experience to sample out their selection of sake .  we also ordered the tofu sliders and the beef brisket ramen .  both dishes were excellent and delicious !  the creamy ramen broth was savory and spicy ,  and the noodles tasted very fresh .  i wish it did have more slices of beef ,  especially since it is a bit pricy of a bowl  ( $14 )  .  however i still highly recommend trying out this ramen because it is so flavorful and filling .   also the service was friendly and professional .  our waitress was very knowledgable of the menu and accommodating for food substitutions .  they have so many dishes on their menu ,  so we look forward to returning here to try out more items ,  especially the sushi rolls ! 
__label__3 price is good but where are the flavors ?  ion ' t taste anything .  i had the shrimp & lobster egg rolls - barf .  like all i tasted was dough .  the pork belly flat bread is a solid 7 though so not all is wasted .  i am however plenty mad at the glass of wine being the same price as the bottle .  but oh well .  i ' m here with my newborn fbf so we ' re happy . 
__label__1 i had a horrible experience and will not go there for any type of car service .  to avoid disappointment & frustration ,  i recommend that others look elsewhere for car services .    i took my car in so they could install a remote starter .  i already had a lock / unlock function on my key fob but wanted the remote start function .  when i got my car back and received my keys ,  i naturally asked where my lock / unlock functions were on the new key fob .  they told me that it would be an extra $40 .    the problem is ,  no one told me that it would be extra to have that function .  a good business who cares about their customers would have seen that i had that function on my fob and told me about the charge in order to keep the lock / unlock feature and be happy with the service .  instead ,  i received an apology .  i received no discount .  they insist that i pay full price and act like there ' s nothing they can do about it .  whenever i call them ,  the manager is always conveniently busy .  i live far away and can ' t call off work just to get this done .    simple customer service goes a long way; it can make or break a business .  they ' ve got a lot to learn about how to rectify their mistakes . 
__label__4 i went to sweetie fry as the +1 for a yelp event .   the experience left me impressed with the establishment ,  but i ' m unlikely to go back .   as a food experience i ' m confused what void in available restaurant selections is filled by a place that serves fries and ice cream .   they obviously put a lot of effort into producing a quality product ,  in particular i thought the ice cream was excellent - lots of flavor and not overwhelming sweetness .   so if i do wind up back here it ' ll be an after-dinner stop . 
__label__4 good stuff !  !  !  fries were pipein hot !  the french toast ice cream was extremely good and perfect for the hot 70+degree day we had .  but i did have to add a lil bit of spice a lil dab of chocolate chilli ice cream will do !  !  beware tho hot days brings lines out the door
__label__5 wow !  sweetie fry is serving up some of the best frozen treats in town !  they make all of their ice cream in house ,  from scratch .  you can literally see the owner making it .  they have an incredible selection of ice creams that are unique ,  tasty ,  and of course - creamy !  i tasted the french toast ,  peanut butter fudge ,  granola ,  and deep chocolate raspberry marmalade .  the salted caramel sauce is incredible !  !  and the service is tremendous . 
__label__4 the owner was super generous with food and drink .   i especially loved the goat cheese ice cream  ( you gotta try it !  )  . 
__label__5 love the ice cream ,  didn ' t try the fries yet but will definitely be back ,  finally an ice cream place with in walking distance
__label__5 wow !  what a great find .  we got the pizza fires /  bacon cheese fries and funnel fries .  they were all amazing .  i think the funnel fries are a must for anyone .  they were melt in your mouth amazing !  great services and such a cute building . 
__label__3 i wanted to love this place ,  honestly .  as a local i ' ve heard about sweetie fry and how amazing it is from many different people .  .  . however after going a few times i can say that it is not as great as i had hoped .  the food is overpriced ,  first of all .  sure the ice cream is homemade and the flavors are unique ,  but not worth the cost by any means .  the quality is just okay ,  not great .  the fries are very good but again very pricey .  on weekends the place gets crazy crowded and there are only three or four tables inside .   overall i just expected more after hearing so much .  it is a cute idea and a friendly environment but i think they should bump up the quality of the food if they are going to keep the same prices . 
__label__5 so sad to learn of sweetie fry closing .  this was one of the quirkier joints that i was proud to have in my neighborhood .  i mean .  .  .  who else serves gourmet fries with handcrafted ice cream ?  seriously !  ?  the fries were "impossibly good" and the ice cream was creative .  keith ' s artisan skills really came through with some of the off the wall flavors like strawberries with sour cream ,  goat cheese ,  and maple bacon .  they were really good .  on their last day ,  i decided to stop by 15 mins before they closed and snatch up a couple of pints of whatever they had left .  got some turkish coffee and coconut .  i was very disappointed .  .  .      .  .  .  while i was eating it when i realized that it would be the very last time i ' d be enjoying this treat from sweetie fry .  i really hope keith just takes some time off to regroup ,  draw up a new plan ,  and come back even stronger some time soon .  it is businesses like this that shape the unique characters of our neighborhoods and we need them to succeed !  hope to see you again in the future ,  sweetie fry ! 
__label__5 the kid behind the counter ,   the guy in back ,  the parmesan truffle fries ,  the butter marsala sauce .  .  . holy awesomeness
__label__4 this is our favorite place to go for ice cream .  charming little shop ,  great servers ,  and a wonderful variety of creative ice cream flavors .  the sweetie scoop is an extra treat on top of your cone or bowl .  love the fact that i can try any flavor before i order .  we ' ve never had the fries cause were so addicted to the ice cream but we ' ve heard they ' re fantastic too .  sweetie fry has better ice cream and prices than their overrated competition . 
__label__4 i am a fan !  what a smart idea - fries and ice cream .   waffle fries ,  might i add !  or sweet potato fries ,  if that ' s what you fancy .   the dipping sauces are great .   i tried the indian masala and the curry lime .   both were amazing ,  though i actually think the curry lime beat out the indian masala by just a tad .   waffle fries were okay by itself .   fried to a nice crisp ,  but the sauces definitely made it outstanding .   this place reminds me of pomme frites in ny .   so happy to find a replacement in cleveland ! 
__label__4 ok ,  a little indulgence can be fun .   two fun ,  indulgent foods ,  ice cream and french fries ,  brought together in one place .   add exceptional service and quality of product .   add a fun environment .   you have sweetie fry .   great place to go after school or work ,  just to chill out and have fun .   wish them success . 
__label__5 we happened upon this place while in the area for dinner .  it is new to the area and was delicious .  they have a great blend of unique and classic flavors ,  so it will appeal to the adventurous and traditional ice cream eaters .  the owner was especially nice and let us taste different flavors .    we didn ' t get to try the fries  ( to full from dinner )  but what a delish combo ,  sweet and salty .  yum !  worth the money ,  we paid less than $5 to share . 
__label__1 horrendous service .  .  .  . i never thought i ' d say i miss the old panini ' s ,  but at least they knew how to tend to their customers .  it took well over 20 minutes for the waitress to finally pickup the credit card ,  not to mention never any checking in on the customer ,  it took concerned looks to draw any attention .  management should truly be ashamed of themselves .  you ' re better off going to red lantern ,  backstage ,  or even steak and shake . 
__label__5 i absolutely love this place !  i would come here everyday if i could .  best fresh pressed juices in cleveland .  also try the avocado pudding and the bravocado !  !  amazing . 
__label__1 i visited cleveland to support the case medical school doc opera ,  which was donating the obtained money to the cleveland free clinic to help keep it running .  we stayed overnight at our son ' s apt as the event ended later than expected after 10 pm and driving back to buffalo at 11 pm was not a safe thing to do after a long day working before coming in .  parked outside his apt on overlook ,  checking all of the signs to make sure i was obeying the law .  came out in the morning to find the very hard working and highly trained  police had spent their evening ticketing people for parking ,  with no signs to warn you or tell you not to park on their streets paved with gold from 3-6 am .  glad i came to spend 25$ for the event so i could spend another 20$ for a parking ticket in this holier than thou town with a loser police department .  if you want to keep people off the streets 3-6am then put up signs and we will obey them .  this happens in the south and in the fearful lilly white suburbs ,  and cleveland heights is neither .  when and if i return i will never spend another dime in the cleveland heights book store ,  restaurant ,  toy store ,  all of which i had done before i found the little gift from the great and mighty enforcers of cleveland heights; i will save my money to pay for the stupid ticket i will get for parking in the wrong place or at the wrong time or for not calling the desk officer  ( which i found out about on their web site; how 1950s .  .  .  )  to get a permission slip or for them forgetting i called .  i guess they do not want visitors to their emerald city of fear .  their attitude has to change if they want hard working people to come and spend time and money in their little haven . 
__label__5 the cleveland heights police department has been amazing in every aspect .  i mean i look at the reviews and have to laugh .   don ' t do something to get a parking ticket and you won ' t get one .  or ,  if you get one .  pay it and you won ' t get further fines .  its really simple people .   they ' ve helped in so many situations recently and if it weren ' t for them ,  i wouldn ' t be here .  so ,  thank you ! 
__label__3 staff was nice and friendly .  shuttle service to hospital campus was amazing .  rooms are very nice ,  clean and updated .  the bar / restaurant is nice however ,  bartender service is extremely slow .  waited almost 15 mins while the bartenders walked back and forth without even being greeted and another 10 mins before getting drinks .  this happened both nights during our stay .  food was good but again ,  food service was extremely slow wait 30 mins for toast .  .  . toast !  45 mins for pizza and fried pickles .  being the only source of food for us this was frustrating .  this is why they got a 3 from me .  would of been a 5 if service was better . 
__label__1 while the hotel itself is reasonably nice ,  you are forced into $18 valet parking that is not .  they are slow and did almost $600 worth of damage to my brand new car .  of course ,  the hotel ' s response is that parking is handled by a separate company .  that would be a company they hired and force you to use .   the hotel is spartan ,  having no available microwave .  this seems ridiculous for a hotel on the cleveland clinic campus that caters to out of town patients ,  many of whom may well have special dietary needs .  the lack of complementary coffee in the lobby is also a minus .  the breakfast buffet while good is an additional change .   while some of the desk staff were outstanding others were clueless .  you can quickly tell the difference .  the bell captain was simply annoying .  he gets really testy if you want a cart to handle your own luggage .    in all ,  i would not stay at this hotel again .  i would suggest staying further out ,  driving to the cleveland clinic and using their parking .   stayed july 2016 ,  traveled with family
__label__5 we were told that the hotel had just opened days before our stay .  we would have never known .  the staff was friendly ,  helpful ,  and courteous .  the bartenders had great recommendations for us to do while we were in their city .  the hotel was beautiful and comfortable .  thank you to everyone for making our stay so enjoyable ! 
__label__4 it is your typical dive bar crowd and all .  we went there for breakfast because they were one of the places where we could get it at 11 on a friday and also get a bloody .  bloody mary mix is made in house and is delicious .  bartender was very cool and our drinks were poured right .  yea it is a dive bar so if you want something fancier you probably shouldn ' t go there .  we ordered a simple breakfast and it was pretty good .  no complaints at all .  the crowd was interesting and nice .  will definitely visit again if we are in the area . 
__label__4 i love this place .  it ' s definitely a dive bar / restaurant hole in the wall but the staff is friendly and food is cheap .  i just enjoy this place ! 
__label__4 a neighborhood bar with tasty appetizers and strong drinks !   it doesn ' t take long to become a  ' regular '  there; good vibes ! 
__label__1 will never go back .  ordered a makers mark on the rocks and got fruit fly ' s in the bottom of my drink !  !  !  !  !  the barmaid is very rude and acted annoyed when i complained about the disgusting bugs in my drink !   food and drinks are cheap ,  but beware !  !   the staff basically ignores anyone who isn ' t a "regular" ,  i guess they don ' t complain about flies in there drinks !  it is very dirty and smells in the bar .  didn ' t try any food  ,  lost my appetite after the disgusting drink !  !  ! 
__label__5 the experience here was absolutely magnificent .  a special friend took me here and explained in detail the charm this establishment provided .  wow did it not disappoint !  !    the portions were huge .  the taste was amazing .  the price extraordinarily low .  the service was delightful .    i just can ' t find anything critical to say .  i only hope that i can visit the area again soon so that i may stop back here !  : ) 
__label__4 when we first moved here ,  i remember being so pumped that not only was there a grocery store within walking distance ,  but it was a local one at that !  this grocery store is above average for the area in my opinion .    produce is almost always good quality .   i ' ve only had problems with the avacados - they are rarely ripe here and when they are ,  they usually aren ' t good inside - i go to wf for those .  other than that ,  they have lots of organic options and the selection is reasonable for a what is really a pretty small grocery store .  the quality of the deli meat and cheese is very good  ( they carry boar ' s head brand which not all stores do )  .  i find the meat to be fresh and good quality as well .    the only dig i have is the checkout .  the workers on the floor are really helpful and will run around trying to find you what you need ,  check to see if there ' s more cilantro in the back ,  etc .  but the baggers and checkers .  .  .  .  . spotty .  some are speedy ,  friendly and great .  but the majority are lazy high-schoolers for whom the fact that they actually have to work is just really messing up their  ' me '  time .  most of them are too busy looking around ,  chatting with the guy at the next lane ,  etc .  to make sure your tomatoes make it home in one piece or that they make it home at all .  the other day ,  the guy  ' missed '  my meat and sour cream while bagging my stuff .  luckily i noticed them  ' hiding '  in plain sight before i walked away .  when i pointed out that he very nearly cost me 8 dollars in lost groceries ,  his response was  ' my bad '  .  um .  .  . that ' s not the same as  ' sorry '  .    but i really can only take one star away because the majority of the staff are great and we ' re just really lucky to have an independent grocery store within walking distance .  of course whole foods has better produce and giant eagle has 12 different brands of paprika for you to choose from but it ' s really not a fair comparison .  they aren ' t trying to be whole foods or giant eagle - they ' re doing fine just being zagara ' s . 
__label__1 in my younger and more vulnerable years i remember thinking zagaras was the hip grocery store .  this was pre-trader joes / whole foods ,  pre-bi-rite buyout .  back when zagaras was still the old store ,  before they built the new store .   yet every time i go there now it is the old ray kroc proverb ,  "as long as you ' re green ,  you ' re growing .  as soon as you ' re ripe ,  you start to rot . " apparently zagaras has been ripe for a few years now because they are selling rotten moldy veggies and fruit .   at first i passed it off as my bad selection techniques ,  but then all the seedless cucumbers i would buy were slimy ,  some with mold hidden beneath packaging ,  all the apples would have a well hidden soft spot ,  and bananas would never ripen properly and go from green to black faster than marker day at kermit the frog ' s house .   aside from the fruit / veggie situation .  .  .  they have a pretty small selection of items .  i . e .  they have a million types of cereal ,  but little variety of other items .  the bakery bread is a let down and the best choice you have is buying the stone oven bread they sell .  and the baggers have no qualms about throwing your bread underneath your cans of soup while talking to the cashier and treating you like you are wasting their time by shopping .   in short ,  i was sad to see zagaras take this turn ,  i wanted to have a reason to shop there and not whole foods / giant eagle .  i wanted a local neighborhood place that i remember from my childhood to withstand the test of time and not race to the bottom .  i guess i wanted a lot out of the store .  but all i really wanted were vegetables that i could enjoy and fruit that wasn ' t more rotten than cleveland winters . 
__label__1 prices are often at least 30% higher than other grocery stores in the area ,  and the quality of any non-brand-name items is low .  the product selection here is much lower than other stores in the area as well .  i only shop here when i need something in a pinch ,  but often leave with a broken bank on even the smallest of orders .  do not recommend . 
__label__5 cheers in cleveland .  fucking awesome !  neon parma sign .  soulless hanging out with pints in hand .  big / cheap beers .  weirdo parma girls .  greesy food .   this is not doing the  ' saw justice but i ' m drunk as i write and i am wishing it was because i just had five talls of amber bock while watching monday night raw with aaron .   i have never had a bad night here .  even the most normal ,  average sessions end with good conversation or good fried food .  call me a retard but i suggest anyone wishing to move away from cleveland  should spend a few nights here first  , and then ,  reevalute . 
__label__4 not much to say other than this place is pretty good ,  excellent service too with friendly staff .  before yelp i ' ve '  been in here a few times and never had a problem and always got in and out in a timely manner .  the food over all is delicious ,  the jalapeno bagel and blueberry is pure goodness .  and the 6 bagel bundle deal is pretty good too !  just don ' t forget your tube of cream cheese ! 
__label__3 let me first say it has been awhile that i went to this place so technically it would be my first time since they changed the outlook of it as well as their menu .  i was a bit disappointed by their limited items of seafood at least that ' s what they had in their previous menu .  i ordered the salmon and it was just bland .  the atmosphere is inviting and hip .  if you ask if i would visit again ,  i would but not for dinner .  probably a place for happy hour
__label__4 i really dug this place .   it was my 1st time out to the detroit shoreway area and had i not been following a new friend i don ' t think i would have found this place .   it is beautiful inside and was happy we landed at a place with food since i was starving .   i got the mussels which were tasty but i have to say mussels should come with frites and i didn ' t want to spend the $6+ on a big thing of fries i just wanted a few dippers .   luckily the people we were with shared their fries and they were mighty tasty .     my dude got the smoked trout which was ok ,  but lacked some flavor .   i didn ' t get wine  ( cause i was at a bar before drinking beer and i don ' t like to mix my alcohols )  but the wine did look great and there was an amazing selection .   the beer choices were great too and got some ipa that i had never heard of before and can ' t remember now for some reason .   our waitress was a doll and such a beauty and was seriously one of the best waitstaff people i have met in cleveland .   definitely a must try . 
__label__3 nice atmosphere ,  very cool .  almost left when i saw "yolo" on the building .  .  .  trying way too hard there .  but atmosphere made me stay . 
__label__5 i have been here twice only ,  for the monthly wine tasting dinners .  omg it was fantastic !  last night was the veuve cliquot champagne "tasting" dinner .  tasting ?  4 full glasses of the best french champagne ,  including from a $200 bottle ,  plus 4 courses ,  for -- wait for it -- $40 .   not $40 per course ,  people ,  which is what i ' d pay in vegas for the equivalent ,  but $40 total .  mike  ( owner )  and dmitri  ( chef )  must be insane .  and you would be insane to miss the next edition of these monday night wine dinners .    this is now my big date night of the month ,  guaranteed . 
__label__1 yes totally agree ,  had same situation overcharged never return calls ,  attitude like gang member rough gruff ,  something is not right . 
__label__3 stoped in sat for breakfast ordered 3 eggs hash browns bacon coffee service was slow food average eggs cooked perfect  bacon sucks  cheap  bacon rest if food average it ' s a k joint  cost of bill was under 5 . 00 $  dinner and salad bar looked good
__label__5 this neighborhood bakery is just awesome !   small bakeries like this are few and far between .   i stop here on my way to work ,  on occasion ,  and pick up goodies as a treat for my co-workers .   everything is always fresh ,  delicious and inexpensive .   i can ' t believe how reasonable the prices are .   i always leave a little extra ,  because they truly don ' t charge enough ,  especially when i think about $8 desserts that i ' ve had at restaurants ,  that pale in comparison to the fresh baked goodies here .   i ' ll continue to frequent buettners ! 
__label__5 great old world bakery full of fresh yumstrosities .  nice selection ,  no $5 cupcakes here .  everything very reasonable - dozen donuts $8 ,  all super fresh and awesome .   opens early  ( like 6 am ?  )  .  got hooked by walking my dog past in the morning and smelling freshly baked heaven .  i knew it had to be good from the smell ,  and the fact that  stream of people come through even that early .   donuts ,  fritters & croissants are all yum .  even the pizza bagel was light ,  fluffy and well done .  haven ' t gotten through the entire bakery - might not make it thru the door if i do .  don ' t miss it if you are bringing stuff for the office or party or whatever .  prices & quality can ' t be beat .   be warned ,  cash only !  first time i went in ,  i had to leave drooling : ( 
__label__5 buettner ' s doughnuts are the best in the cleveland area at very good price .    i have tried the pizza bagels which are very good ,  the pizza is good if you are looking for a snack of cold pizza ,  i was .   chocolate chip cookies !  !  i pick up a dozen almost weekly for myself  and i take them to michigan when i visit my people as they love the cookies and always request i bring a dozen for them .     five stars for product deliciousness and freshness . 
__label__4 delicious java .  i had a vanilla latte which had a pleasant nutty roast ,  lightly sweetened .  loved it : )  service was genuinely warm and friendly .  highly recommended ! 
__label__5 so happy to have bloom bakery ' s second location open now in the campus district .  their pastries are amazing and breads are delicious .   have used their catering services for lunch meetings and they are top notch and reasonably priced .   on top of all of that - this is a social enterprise of towards employment ,  to help people with barriers to hiring gain skills and have successful careers . 
__label__4 great people .  i enjoyed my visit downtown; as for the campus location my experience was not great but not awful .  i had the tuna salad and a baguette as a side .  my friend tried the curry chicken salad ?   ( sorry i cannot recall the name )  with baguette as well .  the bread was very hard to break apart and eat ,  but it was manageable with a lot of hard work and effort !  the food was decent if you are looking for a quick meal .  overall ,  i ' m glad that they moved closer to campus .   ( : can ' t wait to try more from their menu . 
__label__5 i ' ve been to the bloom at public square before ,  but not this location .    i tried the pastrami with a side of the house potato salad this visit .  the pepper cured pastrami sandwich came with swiss cheese .  i opted for the suggested rye bread ,  but they were out of it so i got wheat .  the sandwich was very good and a thick serving of pastrami was provided .  the pastrami was not as spicy as i was expecting ,  but it certainly can appeal to more palates that way .    the potato salad i really enjoyed .  the potato pieces are kept large and the dressing was not overwhelming in quantity .  the potatoes were cooked skin on and to an al dente quality which kept them from getting mushy in the dressing .     i ' ll also mention that i recently used bloom for a small dessert catering order and they nicely presented 3 dozen cookies .  the cranberry and oat cookie being one of the most wonderful cookies i have had in awhile . 
__label__4 all i ordered from kim se was an order of chili chicken wings ,  and they were very good .  5 wings for a $2 price tag ,  and they had a good mix of sweet and spice in the chili sauce .  the wings were cooked well and had just the right amount of sauce too . 
__label__5 finally !  the eastside has somewhere to go late-night on the weekend .  and what would i ever want more than ice cream or french fries after a night out ?  hmm i know .  .  . both !   i ' m what you would call a chocoholic .  admitting it is the first step right ?  well ,  if sweetie fry ' s deep chocolate flavor is wrong ,  i don ' t wanna be right .  it is just out of this world .  and ,  what ' s that you tell me ?  i get a sweetie scoop too ?  well ,  don ' t mind if i do because i also happen to be a big bacon fan and the maple bacon flavor with real bacon bits in it is the perfect top off on a scoop of deep chocolate .   now the french fries .  you can ' t really go wrong with french fries ,  but you ' re definitely in for a treat if you ' re having gourmet french fries .  three different styles ,  multiple toppings and tasty dipping sauces mean that there ' s a combo for everyone .   and guess what else ?  sweetie fry has dog treats in a jar on the counter !  so bring your four-legged friend along with you !  i know where to take the dog for a walk now !   the owner ,  keith logan ,  is obviously very passionate about making people smile  ( umm hello ,  he picked pretty much the happiest career in the world )  .  he was so friendly and just a cool guy .  i will be back on the reg because there is not a single bad thing about this place in my opinion . 
__label__5 as a person who doesn ' t have any piercings  ( other than ears )  and no tattoos ,  i was very hesitant and worried about finding a place where i felt comfortable .  i did a lot of research and tattoo cafe was very well-reviewed .  i went in on a saturday to get my nose pierced and joe was outstanding .  very professional and extremely calming ,  seeing as how i was very nervous .  he walked me through everything ,  explained every step ,  and was just really friendly .  thanks so much joe ! 
__label__5 wonderful mini golf place with two courses .   easy and hard .   well kept and clean .   next to sweeties ice cream shoppee .   ice cream place is amazing .   swings for seats ,  paper as big as the table for kids to draw on .   they make their own ice cream .   wide selection and fancy yummy treats .   plus probably a 100 types of soda to pick from . 
__label__5 although i didn ' t have the outcome i had hoped for the patient ,  i have to say the that ccf was an outstanding hospital .  the staff from the cleaning folks to the doctors and administrators were as nice ,  friendly and comforting as they could be .  if i ever needed directions to some place  ( and if you have not been to the clinic ,  it ' s huge )  ,  i was escorted there instead of just given directions .  the hospital is incredibly clean ,  parking ample ,  underground and above ground tunnels / walkways so you never have to go outside in the cold of winter or heat of summer .  this was my first experience with the clinic and i have to say they impressed me and certainly met expectations .  unfortunately doctors are human ,  and they cannot cure or save everyone .  .  .  no matter how wonderful a hospital may be .  i would definitely recommend this hospital to anyone who needs any sort of specialty care . 
__label__1 i have had to different experiences .  my son was born six weeks early ,  so we had to deliver at fairview .  it was the closest hospital with a nicu center .  the care we received was excellent .  now for the bad .  my wife had a such a good experience overall with fairview she decided she wanted to deliver our next child there .  so she found an ob at cc branch in elyria .  unfortunately we had a miscarriage .  once the dr informed her of the miscarriage that is where the trouble began .  we were new to the whole miscarriage process .  she informed my wife that her body would take care of it ,  itself .  just basic and i mean very basic information ,  was all she gave us .  said she would call us the next morning .  no phone call and 2 day later my wife almost bled to death .  passed out from all the blood loss ,  had to call the squad .  needless to say i am very upset and will not step foot in her office again .  i feel we should of been informed on what to look for ,  or more information on what to do in certain situations .  at the very least a phone call .  like i said  this review is more for dr .  b .  i surely hope you pay more attention to patients ,  and this was a one time instance . 
__label__5 what a world class place .  recently ranked 2 in the nation according to us news and workd report .  also ranked #1 in cardiology for 22 years straight !  how impressive .  i ' ve always felt like a vip here from the health care staff who have always given me care in a timely fashion to the environmental service workers who give get well cards to the patients .  can ' t say enough about this place .  also they have a 24 hour starbucks !  first time i ' ve ever seen that
__label__1 the doctors are great !   that ' s the only good thing i can say .   the billing and finance departments are a complete disaster .   they will screw up your account ,  over-bill you ,  never call you back .   it would certainly be comical if there weren ' t thousands of dollars on the line .   let me be clear .   this is not someone angry about one bad day or one bad incident .   i ' ve had the misfortune of dealing with the cleveland clinic for over a year .   the 3 or 4 times they screwed us over this time period ,  i let it go .   now i just want to help others avoid my misery .   the billing department is the worst .   last year they tried to charge us thousands of dollars for a service they said would only cost a few hundred .   when we pushed back ,  they insisted it was correct .   we kept fighting it and finally they relented and charged us the correct amount .   now we just realized they charged us twice for the same service .    ( multi-thousand dollars )  .   bad job out of me to not realize it until after we ' d paid it .   but i called 10 times over a period of 2 weeks .   never reached a person in the finance department ,  was only able to leave messages .   they never called me back until i left an angry message and mentioned lawyers .   then suddenly i get a call back 20 minutes later .   are you freaking kidding me .   this proved that my messages were being received and ignored .   oh ,  one more incident that just perfectly summarizes the way they operate:  i went in for an mri on my knee .   they said i ' d get the results in 2-3 days .   i waited .   and waited .   and waited .   then i started calling .   you guessed it .   no answer ,  ever .   just voice mail and never a returned call .   this went on for weeks .   i ' m just wondering if i ' m going to need surgery or what .   finally i left an angry message and posted a message like this one on their general web site .   suddenly i start getting calls .   gee thanks .   they staff their offices with people who are either brutally incompetent ,  or have no interest whatsoever in providing any kind of customer service at all .   all i want is for someone to answer a phone once in awhile .   and these incompetent people ,  with all your medical and financial information at their fingertips ,  are either completely un-supervised--or their supervisors also don ' t care .   only go here if you need highly specialized care .   the doctors are great .   but they will screw up your bill ,  and coincidentally the screw-up is always in their favor--they never accidentally charge too little .   if you do have to go here ,  get everything in writing ,  watch their billing department like a hawk ,  and if you ever need help with someone ,  skip the nice-guy routine and just cuss out the first person you speak to .   that ' s the only way to get someone to help you . 
__label__1 i am still trying to pay my bill at the cleveland clinic .  i call the payment department many times each month and actually speak to a rep maybe 1 out of every 20 times i call .  i have been able to successfully complete 2 out of my 3 installments but this last one has been really hard to get through .  i ' ve even given them my payment information twice in order to complete this last payment; the first time the money never came out of my acct and the second time i called the rep said the computer crashed in the middle of our transaction .  i guess they just don ' t want me to finish paying off my bill .  .  .  they must really like the sound of my voice .  so i ' ve begun paying this bill off in monthly installments last march and i ' ve been trying to make this last payment for about two months .  ugh !  you would think they ' d be more receptive to taking the money i owe them . 
__label__5 as a healthcare provider ,  have been a part of three of the world ' s best .  the cleveland clinic has certainly been one of the best teams to be part of .  sure ,  the place is massive and sadly some people may feel part of a giant machine or patient assembly line .  it is not the goal of this physician lead organization but instead to provide education ,  compassionate care in a world class setting .  i appreciate the amount of work that has gone into making this institution one of the best .  i ' m proud to be part of a great group of physicians . 
__label__5 yes yes yes !  if i have a live threatening medical condition please send me here ,  shoot ill come here for my flu shots with the service i got !   so this review is strictly on the childrend hospital portion ,  more specifically the center for congenital heart disease .   long story short ,  my son was born with a hole in his heart ,  after numerous specialists and the run around i came here on a whim .  the clinic got us in right away ,  gave him all the necessary tests and gave us an outlook that no other clinic was willing to give us .  other doctors talked about cutting my son open and poking and protting him .  dr .  suntharos and his team quickly diagnosed him and advised that he just needed some minor medicine ,  no surgery ,  and he would be any normal happy healthy baby .  you cannot imagine what a relief that was for us .   in addition to the awesome prognosis ,  the clinic went above and beyond our expectations .  validating parking for us so that was one less thing to worry about ,  making sure we were comfortable ,  giving us a private guide because this facility is huge .  i really was taken back at the treatment this clinic gave us .  no wonder they are always either number 1 or number 2 in the country .  the building the main campus ,  was spotless ,  guides and workers everywhere to answer every question that comes through the door .  such professionalism ,  i would recommend this hospital to anybody ! 
__label__1 this review is for park n fly in general .   not necessarily the clev location or the service clev provides .   they do a good job .   it is park n fly corporate that i am upset with .   as of this post i have signed up for another shuttle service and pnf has lost this 11 year customer .     in jan i tried to book some free days to coincide with a business trip .   i was told that they were revamping their "rewards program" and free days can not be redeemed at this time .   so ,  whatever .   no big deal i booked with the agent 7am wed to 4 pm sun .   so what does the agent do ?   she books me for arrival back to clev a few hours earlier meaning i end up paying for additional time .   pnf wouldn ' t adjust the return time when my secretary called them on account of my checking in the morning that she called them .   even this wasn ' t enough to make me switch to another service .   but this is .  .  .  .  .   just this week i received a letter from pnf .  basically it read something like - we have listened to our customers and we have revamped our loyalty program .  .  . blah blah blah .    enclosed with the letter were 10 free parking tickets .   these were the days i ' ve accumulated over 11 years .   i thought ,  wteff !   i called corporate and asked where the rest were and i thought i had accumulated at least 30 days .   she said ,  i had accumulated 33 days but now you get 10 days that expire at years end with the new program .  she said that with the new program i can get diff levels though and if i stay with them more i ' ll get more days .   wwttff !   she had no good explanation for the fact that they just picked my pocket of 66% of my free days .   my final question is - who the heck are these customers that are clamoring for this type of revamping of a loyalty program ?   they can have it ,  i ' m moving on . 
__label__1 parked here for 5 days and it was $66 .  i even had a 15% off coupon from groupon but the lady wouldn ' t accept it because i didn ' t make a reservation online .  she then proceeded to ask if i was a college student ,  which i am ,  but i did not have my college id on me at the time .  so she told me "oh well" .  i had the coupon in hand .  the least they could ' ve done is accepted it this time and tell me to make sure i do it online next time .  the rates are ridiculous .  $66 is what half my round trip flight cost to la .  i ' ll be taking my business elsewhere next time i fly . 
__label__5 easy check in and checkout ,  fast shuttle pick up and return .  definately will recommend to my friends .  will always use if flying out if cleveland again ! 
__label__1 not worth it if you just show up .  apparently you are supposed to come here prepared with a discounted coupon ,  not just out of the blue like i did .  i parked here for 4 days and it cost me $54 .  i could have just parked at the airport and paid that same amount .  isn ' t the lure of parking here that it should be cheaper ?  lesson learned i guess . 
__label__4 i was at cwru for a volleyball tournament recently and there wasn ' t any decent food at the recreation center .  so a hunting we went .  we came across rainbow babies & children ' s hospital and we visited the cafeteria .  i found a salad bar ,  which had tempting ,  fresh offerings .  i scooped up some spinach ,  broccoli ,  cauliflower ,  tomatoes ,  cucumber ,  dried cranberries ,  sunflower seeds ,  and boiled egg and put them into my salad dish .  i also added light ranch dressing .   my salad was excellent and i will keep this healthy option in mind next time i ' m in the neighborhood . 
__label__5 they saved the life of a newborn infant in our family .  truly amazing and heroic .  brilliant staff ,  all of them .  be proud cleveland . 
__label__3 it has been a while since i ate at this restaurant ,  although we have received deliveries from them and have always been pleased .   the decor is ,  in a word ,  old .   i know it is an old restaurant ,  but it could use some updating .   the servers generally reflect this as well .   we ordered the calimari as an appetizer and it was excellent .   the past dishes are generous sized ,  and good value for the price .   service was timely and attentive .   i would continue to order delivery food from them ,  but don ' t know that i would hurry back to dine there . 
__label__5 the stuffed peppers were perfect !  the garlic cheese bread was crunchy and the sauce was fresh and light .  very romantic for our 11 yr anniversary . 
__label__5 family run restaurant for years .  we have met the owner and her daughter rachel who go out of their way to make the experience pleasant .  they have the best gluten free pasta we have ever had and were willing to make many dishes gf .   we had chicken picata and chicken parmesan .   both were delicious .   they have their own parking lot which is definitely a plus ,  because littly italy was hopping last night .   i would agree with others that it is quaint and quirky ,  but if i wanted ordinary we would have eaten at bob evans .   definitely worth the visit . 
__label__2 stopped here and ordered the 3 jumbo cookie special that comes with either water of a fountain drink .  so i ordered a sprite with no ice .  upon which the businesses owner told me that i wouod have to pay double for the drink if i didnt want ice  ( it would be 2 . 00 vs  . 99 )  then i get this whole spill on him being the small guy .  i have never heard of a so called business that charges the customer extra if you dont want them filling your cup up with ice .  on top of that i really think that the owner had kind of a negative demeanor .  i wouldnt recommend this place keep your money and spend it elsewhere ! 
__label__1 quality in food has went down since i first started eating here .  it ' s a hit or a miss !  sometimes it ' s the bomb and sometimes it ' s bad !  !  customer service here is kinda bad !  it seems like they have no interview process and hire just about anyone .  one time i came in and the girl called out "ashley is here for pick up" and and employe said "that bitch ashley is here !  smh customer service is key .  with out customers no money without money no buisness !  get it together mr . beckom !  sam silk fish and chicken is better
__label__1 if it was at all possible to leave no stars i absolutely would .  it is the most frustrating thing when i call this b n m and deal with the employees .  they are extremely rude and highly unprofessional .  there is no understanding of customer service period .   i called this location several times in one evening and repeatedly hung up on when they answer the phone and ask a customer to hold .  further more no one ever returned to the phone after 5 minutes .  this is not the first time this has happened  ( at the b n m in maples heights )  .  i questioned whether or not to leave a review because frankly i have found that black owned establishments know the crowd that they choose to employ and i have never had an experience where unprofessional tactless employees have been adequately  dealt with .  i hope the owners and management corrects this issue with their employees . 
__label__2 had their bbq at their food truck as part of walnut wednesdays .   it was mediocre at best .   the smell was so enticing since they have their grill hooked up to the back of their truck .   i got a pulled pork sandwich and side of macaroni and cheese .   it took about 30 minutes for me to get my food .   luckily i went on my day off ,  but i can ' t imagine doing this on a tight lunch break from work .   when i opened my sandwich from its foil wrapper ,  it looked like regurgitated food .   it was smashed ,  soggy and impossible to eat as a sandwich .   i started in with a fork and the meat was lean  ,  but was not seasoned at all and there was one small squirt of bbq sauce on all of the meat .   the cole slaw served on top  ( which wasn ' t stated on the menu )  was pretty good .   i would never order this meal if i was in business attire or if i had an important meeting later in the day .   the mac and cheese was separating into the oil and cream part of the cheese which was obviously less than appetizing or tasty . 
__label__1 went to this location around 9:40pm and ordered a 10 piece with 3 large sides .  i paid almost $30 .  when i got home ,  discovered that my "10 piece" was actually  pieces of chicken !  !  they actually took full pieces and chopped them up to make 10 pieces of random pieces .  i will never eat nor refer another soul to this restaurant ! 
__label__5 after driving by this store a million times  i finally took the time to stop and so glad i did .  i have a very difficult chihuahua that  knows the world is his oyster ,  so i was a tad bit worried about taking him into the store but the pugs welcomed him with open paws and doggy treats to settle him down .  .  .  and not to mention the owners are so very hands on and know their stuff assisting me with any question i had !  now you would think it would be pricey but not at all ,  for the amount of food i used to buy at the big box pet store ,  the same amount of food was cheaper at pet tique .  so goodbye big box pet store ,  pet - tique is now our one stop pet store . 
__label__5 how have i not written a review of pet-tique already ?  ?  ?  ?  ?   my dog and i moved to the area earlier this year and i ' m so glad that i found pet-tique !   it is one of those stores that isn ' t just to make money- they ' re really invested in the community .   i have to admit that i was initially afraid that the prices of this boutique style pet store would be higher than other places .   at least when it comes to dog food they ' re the same as the chain stores .   and they have a customer loyalty program that gives perks to frequent shoppers .     they are also very familiar with their products .   i ' ve had a few questions about items and could not be more pleased with how knowledgeable they are .   while some places might make suggestions with the motivation to sell a higher dollar they repeatedly have not .   that sort of treatment makes me feel as though they ' re actually interested in the needs of the customer and in particular the pets !   as a totally indulgent dog owner i do appreciate that !  !  !   the shop is on the small side and parking spots are very limited ,  however; plenty of street parking is available .   in spite of the smaller size of the store they ' ve made the most of their space and i can ' t say enough about how awesome the store is ! 
__label__4 love this store .  would give it more stars ,  but i ' m further away than i ' d like .  is that a good reason to dock a star ?  maybe ,  maybe not .  i also dislike the parking situation and size of the store .  the store is small ,  but they make good use of the space and manage to cram a ton of stuff in without looking messy .    i get that most pet stores welcome your animals ,  but i really feel it here more than any other store .  i ' m regularly encouraged to bring both of my dogs ,  let them play ,  and i don ' t feel like someone is watching for them to knock stuff over .  the owner has encouraged me to let my pug off leash and play with the other dogs .  he loves it in there .  the owner is incredibly knowledgeable and was so helpful after i adopted my pug .  i ' m a crappy owner in the sense that i didn ' t know as much as i should have when i adopted my pug from a rescue  ( and they were not super helpful )  .  the owner has a few pugs and had great advice - very sweet too !    i also love that they will order stuff for you .  i will say i probably would have docked a half star because it ' s a pricier store .  however ,  most of the stuff in the store is worth more ,  especially the dog treats .  there is no purina to be found here and the owner is great about explaining each food - down to the different flavors  ( and has good suggestions !  )  .  i will happily pay more for my dog food and treats ,  but  .  .  .  not so much for their toys .  sorry !  i sound cheap and .  .  .  well ,  i am about certain things .  i ' m a teacher and am comfortable spending more on the food because i know better food makes a huge difference for my dogs  ( seriously: gross warning - my friend buys yuck food for her dog ,  i think purina ,  and the dog constantly has poop issues and is typically .  .  well ,  not so solid .  you want that ?  how would you feel if you were that dog ?  also ,  um ,  if there ' s an accident to be had ,  let ' s have it be more solid ,  okay ?  )  .  okay done .  but back to the price thing and me being a cheapskate .  i don ' t tend to buy the most expensive toys .  i can ' t do it .  while i love some of the cute stuffed toys ,  i also know that my dogs are a bit rough with them .    that said for miss cheapskate  ( who is now typing in third person - i ' m a little sleep deprived !  )  ,  she will happily pluck toys out of the sale bin .  i love that pet-tique has a sale section .  the last time i was there ,  there were probably a dozen toys and a bunch of dog clothes on sale for great prices .  sign me up !    if you buy food here ,  they offer a deal - buy so many bags  ( 5 or 6 i think ?  don ' t quote me )  you get one free .  good deal !  they keep track of it for you on the computer . 
__label__1 40 minutes for a burger on a we ' d ?   ridiculous .   walked out and will never return again .   years ago this was the place
__label__5 an awesome dive bar with great ribs on the west side !  despite living practically across the street for months ,  i never stepped foot inside for food other than the occasional beer .  i ' m happy to say i ' ve had their st .  louis styled ribs with a cajun dry rub and was impressed .  the meat was well cooked ,  the seasoning was fantastic and the sides - fries and coleslaw ,  were fantastic .  decent drink selection too . 
__label__5 they ' ve always done right by me .  .  .  it ' s easy to pick up a nail or two driving around downtown and there aren ' t a lot of tire repair places around tremont .   no question these guys are the best and priced extremely fair . 
__label__1 the shelves are empty ,  the whole place is filthy ,  and you can ' t find anything .  prices ring up different  ( and higher )  than what ' s posted on the shelves  ( even with your cvs card )  .  don ' t waste your time . 
__label__2 a little disappointed with our subs .   they were very dry .   not fresh  !   the cleanliness of this location made us nervous too .   hoping we don ' t get sick from it .   was weird to that the newly baked bread was with in reach of customers hands . 
__label__5 the staff was great and the room was awesome .  lots of challenges and very well done .  they are going to have a new room in a few weeks we will for sure be back . 
__label__4 la casa tazumal is right off lorain on w 105th in a sleepy part of town with street parking .  the outside isn ' t hard to miss ,  with a jungle creeping in the windows near the entrance .  after entering the double doors ,  you ' re greeted to some spanish christian literature and a cozy dining area with plastic table clothes ,  food paintings and a booth selling herbal remedies .   like others have said ,  the restaurant is run by an elderly woman with lots of spirit and seemingly fluent english .  the menu is two pages ,  with a third page for dessert and miscellaneous a la carte items .  horchata and tamarindo is fresh and delicious ,  like dessert in a glass  ( $1 . 25 )  .   i suppose the main draw here are the salvadorean pupusas ,  which resemble colombian arepas .  corn tortillas are split and stuffed with pork ,  beef ,  beans ,  cheese and other goodies .  la casa tazumal ' s are slightly greasy ,  but definitely filling .  for around $1 . 50 each ,  you can eat your fill of pupusas without denting your wallet .   we ate in the dining area ,  and the chef ' s daughter came half-way through and became our waitress in place of her mom .  she brought out some pickled cabbage and other vegetables and a wonderful hot sauce .  my boyfriend had a tamale ,  pupusas and empanada ,  although he had to pack up the empanada .  two pupusas and the horchata filled me up .  we also ordered plantanos frito  ( fried plantain - $2 . 50 )  .  i thought it was going to be deep fried ,  sort of like yoyos or something ,  but it was a plantain ,  split down the center and caramelized .  it was sweet and satisfying ,  but a little heavy for dessert .  we packed it up for later .   la casa tazumal offers a lot of character and great ,  seemingly authentic salvadorean cuisine .  with many other menu options we didn ' t try ,  and a woman who ' s a triumph for opening her own restaurant and keeping a sweet demeanor the entire visit ,  we ' ll definitely be back again .  this place could become a weekly staple . 
__label__2 when i first walked in ,  the restaurant was so cute and small that i thought i was about to get flawlessly tasty authentic mexican food .  my expectations were not met though .   i thought the food was just pretty bland and the meat was so tough that i could barely eat it .    the pupusas were the best part of the meal ,  and i wish that i hadn ' t ordered anything else because they were really good .   if you pay with a credit card make sure you put the tip on the check before she takes it because otherwise you can ' t add a tip . 
__label__2 returning a rental .   service could not have been slower and employees could not have seemed more apathetic .  nothing went wrong .  i just waited an inordinate amount of time before being helped and there was no sense of urgency to be observed .  if i were on a tight schedule ,  i would budget a least 40 minutes for any type of transaction here . 
__label__3 avis has failed me on the last couple of rentals in various cities .   how about no washer fluid in your car in boston during a snow storm and in rush hour traffic ?   how about one of the wiper blades not function and again it ' s snowing and you have a 90 minute drive out in the country ?   seriously ,  it ' s called a checklist and even at minimum wage you should be able to follow one and make my experience a whole hell of a lot more productive for me ! 
__label__1 i was given .  car with a broken drivers seat ,  we did not have enough time to turn around and replace it due to an event .  i tried calling their local office for over an hour to no avail and had no help with their 800 staff .  i had to drive 4 hours in an uncomfortable seat and still haven ' t received any resolution .  very frustrating
__label__1 actual service i ' ve received from avis was good .  however ,  they don ' t tell you that you can ' t leave your car in parking lot in front of the building for more then two hours !  how the hell does that makes since ?  !  only customers they can service are people flying in .  i had to find that out the hard way after my car got towed !  !  will never rent from them again . 
__label__1 i have been waiting 30 minutes in a line of 4 people when there are two workers .  there is no sense of urgency or realization that their whole job is to get people traveling back on the road .  i ' ve seen people at other car company ' s service station wait in line and leave ,  while we are still waiting for this second person in the initial line of 4 to be serviced .  i don ' t know if this is only a local cleveland situation ,  or a widespread avis issue .  either way ,  this is a terrible first experience with avis . 
__label__4 their yelp average is atrocious and reading a few reviews made me a little apprehensive .  we experienced zero problems ,  however .  i have avis preferred plus thanks to work  ( not that i ' ve ever rented for work )  .  i booked online and the rate was surprisingly better than anything else i could find .  and that ' s taking into consideration that we were doing a one-way rental to cvg  ( cincinnati )  ,  so we had to pay for each mile used .   landing at cle ,  i got a notification through the avis app that i couldn ' t pick a car but that one would be ready when we arrive .  the rental facility is a convenient shuttle ride down the road .  we walked straight to the preferred booth and we were in our car in no time .  we ended up with a kia soul that was clean and more than adequate for our needs .   our experience at this avis was minimal ,  but that ' s an indicator of a successful transaction . 
__label__4 i rent at this location about two to three times a month .  being a preferred member ,  i usually dont have to deal with the normal counter people inside .  on my most recent visit my name wasn ' t on the preferred board  ( this happens occasionally )  normally its not at issue ,  i step to the preferred booth to find the most unpleasant person i ' ve ever met steven  !  !  !  normally there is either one of two ladies in the preferred booth  ,  very pleasant and professional .  steve has none of these qualities .  he informed me that he was not trained to add the vehicle to my rental to get me on my way ,  i would have to go inside to have that done !  upon reaching the inside counter ,  i found out from a manager who knows i rent there all the time how completely false that was .  i would love to give steven negative stars but i ' m unable to .  if you see him at the counter ,  as for someone else .  four stars goes to the rest of the staff there ,  they are all very welcoming and show that they appreciate your business .  from lot attendants to the exit gate guys ,  all perfect  . 
__label__1 when i picked up my car they directed me to the appropriate parking slot which had the expected model car .   when i got to the exit gate the attendant said it was the wrong car and i had to back out ,  put the car back ,  and go find another attendant to figure out what was wrong .    they inspected the paperwork ,  couldn ' t find the car ,  and had to reprint new paperwork for a different car .    it was incredibly annoying .      fast forward to returning the car at 5:30am .    supposedly they are open 24hrs but there were no attendants anywhere and all the dropped off cars extended right up to the entrance gate .   we had to park on a side area and hope they find the car .   again very annoying .    there were no signs instructing where to go or what to do .    fortunately we figured it out but it added unnecessary stress .    i picked avis for the 24 hour service .   i even paid more than the competition .    it wasn ' t worth it . 
__label__4 whenever i am hungry ,  and at the cle airport i bee line it to currito .  i like both their burritos and the option to put it in a bowl for those who wish to do so .  it ' s basically you order from the menu ,  pay ,  and watch the assembly line prepare your order .  i usually get the thai option with tofu .  the veggies are fresh ,  and my meal is assembled quickly .  they have a variety of sauces as well ,  including sriracha ,  my fave .  the food is filling ,  and quick .  for vegans like myself you can easily find something tasty here .  with all the food choices in airports these days this is a welcome ,  fast place to get a tasty meal quickly . 
__label__3 decent asian fusion burrito and not super expensive ,  which surprised me in the airport .  i would say the bangkok was a good choice ,  even though the sauce was kind of salty and the tortilla was kind of dry as well .  too much sauce ,  too . 
__label__3 i honestly was hoping currito would be curry-burritos .   imagine how good that would be ?   a wrap with curry and rices; could have korma ,  saag ,  mutter ?   that would be a collision worthy of fireworks .  .  .   be that as it may ,  it is decent mexican for an airport ,  but i daresay i prefer eating in the southwest .  .  .   but perhaps that was asking for a bit much .   2 . 5 stars . 
__label__4 fresh ,  tasty burritos with lots of vegetarian and vegan options .  the buffalo and bangkok burritos are the best .   friendly staff too . 
__label__3 i was really craving mexican when arriving at the airport ,  so i bee lined it to churrito ,  conveniently located close to every security entrance .  i ' ve had their standard burrito before so i thought i would change it up: bangkok burrito bowl ,  please !   not quite mexican ,  it comes with asian slaw ,  peanut sauce ,  cucumbers and rice .  it ' s got a kick ,  but that ' s about all it has - plus ,  it ' s definitely not a peanut sauce ,  a lot more similar to teriyaki .    when i come back  ( because ,  let ' s be honest ,  i ' m always down for a burrito )  i ' ll stick to the classic ,  summer ,  or anything but the bangkok . 
__label__5 best place i ' ve ever gotten an oil change ,  plain and simple .   it was fast ,  affordable ,  and they even washed my car . 
__label__4 fantastic place to have the launch festival for upcoming shows .  will definitely visit more often . 
__label__5 i love playhouse square .  they always have wonderful shows and bring in the best in any type of show business .  playhouse continues to invest in the neighborhood around it ,  which is also wonderful .  it ' s certainly done great things for the revitalization of the city .  the ushers are always cheerful and helpful and wishing you a good night as you leave !  you can ' t beat having broadway productions visit your city and playhouse square is probably one of the nicest places people could perform .  i ' ve visited the theater district in chicago and it ' s nice enough ,  but i do love how almost all of the major theaters at playhouse square are connected .    plus they recently renovated some of the smaller theaters ,  so cleveland state and other colleges and local programs can move in and use the spaces as well . 
__label__5 we went to playhouse square to see "wait wait don ' t tell me" on december 8th and it was amazing !  the red jackets we very knowledgeable and the state theater is extremely beautiful .  one thing that i recommend is to buy parking far in advance !  !  overall my experience was amazing ! 
__label__4 fun theatre .   huge !  many refreshments for sale and lots of time to people watch and drink before show time .   seats are super comfy .   ladies bathroom on main floor had two sinks one of which wasn ' t working .   not cool .      theatre was comfortable in room temperature .   good crowd .  great ron white show .  : )  .  within walking distance of hotel and bars / restaurants including starbucks for am cup of joe .     overall ,  great experience . 
__label__3 i love the the whole vibe of the playhouse square district .    the theatres are beautiful ,  the entertainment top-notch ,  ample nearby parking  ( free if you are willing to walk a block or two )  .   so why only three stars ?   simply put ,  the staff !   my mother and i have been subscribers for years and each year the renewal process is worse than the one before .    the sales staff are pushy and demanding and not willing to even discuss other seating options .     more than likely my last year with renewal ,  i would just as soon save the money and buy better tickets to the one or two shows that i really want to see . 
__label__3 america ' s got downton .   the show is very funny .  it is a one man show that spoofs the downton abbey show . 
__label__5 so we purchased tickets to see the evil dead musical .  a )  the musical was great !  b )  the theatre is so cool !   the location is architecturally amazing and has a crazy cool history  ( according to the program )  .  the staff  ( redcoats )  were so friendly and helpful .  everyone appeared to really enjoy their job .   i loved the area around the square .  amazing lights and bustling with people .  i so want to go back and watch some other production .  i had a great experience . 
__label__4 really charming restaurant .  the owners played the accordion for us the last time we were there .  and the food and wine were lovely too !  try it ! 
__label__4 i ' m not generally not a fan of little italy restaurants .   the area is generally too busy ,  parking is too difficult ,  and i ' ve not found the food to be nothing spectacular .   we went here on a saturday night for a family dinner to welcome our son home from dinner .   what a unique ,  positive experience .   very memorable .   the appetizers and entrees were very good .   the desserts were outstanding .   service was very attentive and great .   the atmosphere hit it out of the park .   live piano music with seasonal songs and broadway and movie themes .   hearing "as time goes by" was amazingly romantic .   and then the owner put on his accordion ,  went to each table to play a song with the hostess ,  who has a beautiful operatic voice singing along .   it added a great amount to the evening .   also ,  valet parking is provided for a small fee ,  right in front of the restaurant .   although you could probably find more spectacular food elsewhere ,  the overall experience here is special .   highly recommended . 
__label__5 fresh calamari cooked to perfection and a delicious take on bruschetta started our 14th anniversary meal at gusto .  my beautiful wife had gnocchi in pesto with gouda that was light and flavorful .  my veal shank was cooked perfectly and the marrow was silky and decadent .  capped the meal off with cannoli ' s that reminded us of a south philly bakery we love .  crystal our server was attentive and sweet and the beer is cold .  all around wonderful experience we recommend ! 
__label__5 huge thank you to gusto and staff who saved the day for us !  they took in our group of 25 wedding rehearsal dinner guests last minute when maxis in little italy saddley double booked their banquet room and were unable to accommodate .  gusto gladly took us in ,  sat us comfortably ,  and quickly made a wonderful italian meal .  service ,  staff ,  food were all excellent and they truly saved our rehearsal dinner !  ! 
__label__4 great car wash ,  i only wish i was closer .  the line was super long when i stopped here ,  but they have a fantastic system to expedite the process .  there are 4 pay lanes ,  and each is timed perfectly to let folks through when it ' s their turn .  this keeps the line moving and ensures that everyone gets a fair wait time .  i did find the checkout to be a little confusing ,  not because of the computer system itself ,  but because of the "upcharge" options .  their washes are priced out by options anyways ,  so i don ' t see the point of $2 and $3 upcharges for services you can get if you just upgrade your wash .  i think it ' s just a tricky way to get people to spend more money .  although the pay station is automated ,  they do have staff working the front in case you need something .  in my case ,  i had a yelp check-in offer ,  which they gladly upgraded for me when i asked .  this is a soft-cloth wash ,  so it ' s much gentler than the brushes .  it does run your car through pretty quickly ,  so i ' m not sure how thorough it is ,  but my car looked pretty darn shiny when i got out .  i just wish they had hand dry /  towel dry in addition to the air blowers ,  but still the wash was great for what i payed and i would definitely return if i was in the area .  i also want to mention that they have great package deals if you know you ' ll return and want to save a few bucks ! 
__label__5 my fianci  ( now wife )  and i decided to do a fun and exciting first dance for our wedding .  we asked rock city dance studio to help us choreograph it .  we could not be happier with the two instructors  ( edith and jj )  who helped us create our dance .  ken even helped us create the music mix .   our friends and family were very surprised and they loved it !  !  !  !  !    thank you so much for your help .  i would recommend them to any couple who would like to do something fun for their wedding .   thanks again ,  alex and angie nadiak
__label__5 my go to neighborhood bar .  the food is absolutely delicious and the live music is some of the best in cleveland .  a real gem with an unwarranted bad rep .  tilapia alfredo and scampi dinner are both extremely delicious .  drinks are pricey .  . but oh well . 
__label__2 over-priced average tasting food .   my husband i ordered 1 drink each ,  the hummus appetizer ,  he ordered the ny strip and i ordered the chicken francaise  ( which was oddly soggy )  .   total bill was $124 .   in comparison to similar priced restaurants ,  it was below average .   i was so excited to try this place out ,  but was seriously disappointed with the food .   the restaurant itself is beautiful and it was quite entertaining to sit and watch everyone coming and going in the valet parking area .  .  .  .   but that ' s about it . 
__label__4 had a wonderful time with mitchell for brunch today !  !  we were celebrating and he and melissa really went above and beyond to ensure we had a good time !  had the adega omelet with great success ,  was delicious ,  would recommend it !  will definitely be a return costumer for bottomless brunch ! 
__label__5 awesome menu and food selections !    will be back often !    has great setting ,  and location .   have no doubt this will be one of cleveland ' s finest ! 
__label__4 delicious food and neat ambiance .  good for group dining .  the brussels sprouts were finely done with a honey glaze .  paella was very favorable and certainly serves more than 2 .  one of my a favorite spots in cleveland ! 
__label__4 i had a really good experience here .   i ate here for lunch and tried the salmon dish .   the taste was excellent ,  service was great ,  but it was a bit expensive for lunch .   it would definitely have five stars if not for the price .   i definitely recommend if you are looking for an infrequent lunch spot ,  or a place to take a client . 
__label__5 came here for brunch on a saturday .  their adega flatbread was served hot and crispy .  i got a side of pancake ,  it is very delicious .  it was a big portion too .   coffee was expensive
__label__5 i ' ve gone for both lunch and dinner know and very much enjoyed both .  my favorite restaurant in town ?  of course not ,  but still an excellent meal and a fairly good value . 
__label__1 the food was decent ,  but the service was unacceptable .  took way too long to get our meals .  our server was obviously ignoring us as we awkwardly stared ,  wondering what was possibly taking so long ,  when the manager came over to tell us they accidentally gave our meals to the wrong table .  this manager did nothing to rectify the situation .  while the food was mostly good ,   ( i didnt care for the dessert )  will not be returning anytime soon . 
__label__4 i love this little hole in the wall place near coventry village .  the dog house serves up variations on a hot dog .  i had the "atlanta" -- so delicious .  the corn dogs aren ' t bad either .  it ' s great to go on a breezy summer day and sit outside with a dog house hot dog ! 
__label__1 this place is awful !  was not what it was years ago .  .  .  we bought three bottles and we ' re expected to go to the bar ourselves to get the bottles ,  cups ,  and mixers .  was told we would have a private vip section that would fit all guests .  it was a little area that didn ' t even fit the bottles on the tables and it was shared with others .  this place is a dump !  !  i didn ' t know the warehouse district could get this trashy . 
__label__3 you can rent the upstairs private room at a very reasonable rate .  the downside ?  it gets crazy hot up there in the summer .  they do have a little rooftop patio you can escape to for some air .    they play techno-type music  ( sorry that i don ' t know the correct term for it )  and it sort of reminds me of a european bar from the early 2000 ' s i was at .    the crowd here can really vary .  it does seem to be a little less annoying than the average "club" goer on w .  6th . 
__label__4 a little hidden gem .  very cute and cozy ,  for all the right reasons .  food was authentic  .  .  .  definitely get the spanakopita and the cocktails are made fresh .  our waitress / bartender was a bit frazzled but cute all the same . 
__label__2 went here to have a late dinner with my girlfriend ,  really nice looking spot with a very charming little bar .  family owned i ' m assuming and and bartender was as nice as she was slow .  our appetizer came out before our drinks ,  odd .  if you are looking for a value do not go here !  !  !  8 oz of frozen cavatelli $20- again everybody was very nice but it is so so so slow in here ,  just terrible .  i would not go here again and i wouldn ' t recommend anyone else does- also the cook was walking around the dining room in a sleeveless shirt (  think that he was the owner )  either way that ' s gross- get it together tony-
__label__2 i really really wanted this place to be my favorite restaurant in tremont .    decidedly not so .  as everyone has mentioned ,  it ' s a tiny room ,  very dark and very cool .  i want to go back for cocktails on a snowy night in december .    just don ' t eat there .  trust me .  the menu is  ( from a design viewpoint )  kind of a joke .  there are about 6 pages of menu and about 6 pages of blah blah talking about how everything is old world ,  made from scratch etc .  listen bartender lady ,  if your food can ' t speak for itself ,  no amount of text is going to convince me otherwise .  me and my girlfriend went on a friday night and were very disappointed in the experience .  we got the meatball app ,  which is literally two meatballs ,  smaller than golf balls ,  for $8 .  friends ,  these are not worth four dollars a piece .  bland bland bland ,  much like everything else we had .  so we had 3 cocktails total ,  the two meatballs ,  two  ' piccolini '  pizzas and a pasta entree .  $85 and we were still hungry when we left .    i hate to be the world ' s biggest cynic ,  but i have a really really hard time believing that everything is made from scratch in a restaurant that is open two nights a week for ten hours total over those two days .  i ' ve worked in the business for a long time ,  there ' s simply no way they ' ve making all that stuff fresh and it really doesn ' t taste like it .  i really don ' t mind paying good money but it ' s gotta be worth it and tony ' s is just not worth it .  i ' ve honestly had better italian at brio .  sad but true . 
__label__5 somehow i always manage to stretch my birthday into a three-week event .  .  .  .  .  tony ' s southside was my absolute favorite of all my birthday dinners this year !   we ended up getting a couple cocktails ,  meatball appetizer ,  three pizzas  ( my favorite was the prosciutto and hot peppers )  ,  a beer ,  glass of wine ,  dessert and one cup of coffee .  the bill was almost $100 .  although i wasn ' t the one footing the bill that evening ,  i can honestly say that this place is worth it !    the ambience and the homey-friendliness of the husband / wife / sister running the place was incredible and the food was so great .  they use a sunday-style meat sauce rather than pizza sauce which has so much depth and pairs perfectly with the sweetness in their pizza dough .  i am drooling remembering it .    keep in mind ,  their pizza is not meant to be scarfed down but savored and appreciated; there is so much flavor and texture going on .  i can ' t wait to go back for more . 
__label__4 my fave place to get lottery ,  a 40 ,  talk to a tranny and cop some rocks all in one little ohio city bogeda !  ! 
__label__4 this place has  all small items a person needs and very close to home with great costumer service . 
__label__1 walking in- there is a small sitting area with 6 seats .  the floors seem a little dirty but it ' s mostly from the weather outside .  this is my first time here so we ' ll see how it goes .   nails- some of the nails are squared ,  some are not so square and more rounded ?  also ,  some of the nails she put on aren ' t big enough and my actual nail is rough and on the side .  .  .  .  not going back . 
__label__5 we love this place !  they did a great job with the remodel and have tons of pool tables so you almost never have to wait to play .  lots of tv ' s for watching games .  the food is surprisingly great for bar food ,  big juicy burgers ,  fresh flavorful wings ,  fresh cut fries and a menu with lots to choose from .  great beer selection and the servers / bartenders are super friendly and attentive .  daily food and drink specials ,  and reasonable prices on all the food and drink on the menu .    family friendly atmosphere .  we see young children with their parents in the dining area for dinner all the time .  their outdoor patio is also nice and you ' re welcome to bring your dog .   every tuesday is "hero night" where drafts are two bucks .  show your police ,  fire ,  or military id and your meal is free !    show your support for a local business that supports the men and women who protect and serve our country ,  you won ' t be disappointed ! 
__label__1 i went in to buy a gatorade because it ' s so warm .  i immediately slipped on what looked like diarrhea but it was actually coffee .  some lady named april snorted at me "just stepped over it" .  i went to bathroom to clean off my shoe and a man walked out .  he had left the seat up and urinated all over the wall too .  i told a guy named ryan about it and he laughed .  i felt disgusted and i will never go back .  get it together and pay attention to 1 . cleanliness 2 . customer service 3 .  losing  the tudes . 
__label__4 i was so excited to see fresh catch opened a downtown location .  the service is fast and the cook always has a smile and something nice to say .  the fish is always fresh and fries are hot .  they could ease up on the seasoning some days but it doesn ' t stop me from returning .  great spot to grab lunch and if you call in ,  your food usually doesn ' t take more than 15 minutes .  definitely a go to for lunch .  one downside is that there ' s no parking ,  so put on your walking shoes . 
__label__5 i recently had action maids clean my house and i thought they did a great job !   the two woman arrived right on time and asked me what sort of cleaning i wanted .   within 2 hours ,  my house was spotless and i will definitely use this company again for cleaning . 
__label__1 do not use this service !  scheduling started great ,  i wanted next day service  ( saturday )  because i was showing my house at 2pm on that saturday but they were booked ,  the scheduling employee i spoke to took my info and said she would call if there was a cancellation .  within the next couple hours i received a call .  she asked what i wanted ,  i said i need a top to bottom cleaning of my whole house ,  i have a showing .  she said "so two hours ? " i said ,  "idk ,  i need ceiling to floor ,  1300 sqft home ,  3 beds 2 bath so whatever that is going to take . " she said ,  oh yeah two hours is what you need .  so she set me for 10-12 saturday morning ,  my showing was at 2 so that worked .  the maids arrived asked to go through the home with them ,  i showed them the house 3 beds ,  2 baths ,  great room ,  kitchen and laundry room were to be cleaned and i said again "top to bottom ! " she said anything important to make sure of ,  i said "all base boards ,  windows ,  blinds ,  curtains and walls" they said "walls are an additional cost" i said "are base boards windows and blinds additional ? " they said "no" i told them to disregard the walls then .  i was outside mowing the law when i was told they were done ,  i was raised to tip for services so i provided them a tip and they went on their way .  while straightening up the home shortly after i noticed i paid $180 for a incomplete ,  half done job .  they didn ' t touch my baseboards in my great room or my kitchen ,  didn ' t touch my counter tops ,  didn ' t do a thing in my laundry room ,  didn ' t clean my front windows lining the door ,  there was dirt and dust still on the floors of my kitchen .  they did not ask me to walk through and make sure everything was good before they left ,  i had another person here who observed that they spent all their time in the bedrooms and bathrooms which had already been prep vacuumed and dusted the previous night and hardly no time in main room or kitchen and when there two hours were up they were done and that was that .  i called immediately action maids tried to get me to do a redo cleaning for the following monday which was pointless since my showing was about to happen ,  i said at this point i want some type of refund .  he said he have a manager call me monday ,  no one called i called them ,  they said that there were tools on the counter and i had a time limit .  ummmm there was like a hammer screwdriver and pack of nails ,  there maids apparently don ' t know how to work around and or scoot things .  the time limit was set by there customer service as adequate for what i told them i wanted .  i asked for half back because they did half my house .  she said she ' d talk to the owner and get back in a day .  i heard nothing for a week .  called again and said i was sent a letter denying the refund  ( i hadn ' t received yet )  because i tipped them ,  and there were tools on the counter and they met there two hour limit !  !  !  !  i told her i will just pursue the bbb then ,  she transferred me to the owners vmail were i left a message and am waiting on a return !  worst $180 i ever spent on a service ! 
__label__1 wanted a simple bouquet for a family member .  i chose all the flowers ,  no trimming ,  put them on a piece of paper  and asked for for some greenery and was told that i had to pay for flower arranging $40 more .  ridiculous .  won ' t ever go back .  totally low class .  low end service here . 
__label__4 i brought my mom and niece and my mom said the cook was heaven sent .  great service and food . 
__label__5 checked out these gents on their first night at the cleveland night market .  looks to be an interesting addition to the food culture to our city .  so ,  if you don ' t know already ,  shaved ice is a classic frozen treat in many asian countries- often topped with sweet toppings like fruit ,  red beans ,  mochi ,  etc .  .  .   it ' s an amazing treat ,  especially when the heat rises .   there was quite a line to get a taste but it gave me the chance to my choices .    the brothers james and john ,  i think ,  we ' re very friendly and answered the questions people had patiently .  i got a traditional ice with condensed milk and raspberries and mochi .  it was tasty ,  though i would have liked to put more ingredients in mine .  good quality raspberries and finely shaved ice made for a refreshing treat .   it ' d be nice to have one that had the works so you could get a sample of all the toppings .     next time i ' ll get the red beans ,  and it ' d be nice to get other traditional ingredients like sweet corn .  looking forwards to coming back again .  great job guys ! 
__label__5 i had the opportunity to try lance ' s beef when i ordered a burger at great lakes brewing company .   truly amazing .   i ' m a burger snob ,  and this was absolutely one of the best grinds i ' ve ever had .   fresh and flavorful all the way .   this is definitely a local cow .   i ' d be happy to do away with the burger toppings just to get more of the amazing mouthfeel .     as i regularly buy my groceries at the west side market ,  i ' ll be sure to buy my beef from lance ' s and post a follow-up from the retail side of things . 
__label__3 i ' ve been eating at this arby ' s for years ,  yet i have never written a review .   well ,  it ' s about time .  i love their hot italian subs .  they are delicious .   today ,  i tried the buffalo chicken sandwich ,  but it was disappointing .  the sandwich fell apart while i was eating it .  it just didn ' t hold together well .  the bread was a little tough  ( almost like a pretzel )  and there was way to much buffalo sauce .   i think i ' ll stick with what works next time . 
__label__4 service here is always good ,  and there ' s very little wait even though they are at a busy intersection .   good food .   i love that jamocha shake
__label__2 i was disappointed in arrabiata ' s .  the food was ok; the service was the really disappointing part .  our server said my daughter was "too cute" to need to order a drink .  um ,  what ?  !  then ,  we had to ask multiple times to receive bread ,  when the little one obviously needed something to snack on .  on top of that start ,  our water wasn ' t refilled in a timely matter .   as i said ,  the food was ok ,  but there wasn ' t really anything to make me want to come back .  i ' ve heard good reviews before ,  so hopefully this was just an off night . 
__label__5 best italian food in the area !  we love their lunch menu because the prices are very reasonable .  eggplant parmigiana is the best i ' ve ever had .  friendly staff and fast service .  restaurant looks small from the outside but ambiance is great for a business lunch or even a romantic dinner . 
__label__2 might have been the worst meal i ' ve ever had here .  normally ,  the good is stellar so i dont know if this was just a fluke ,  maybe new chef ?  ?   started with the fried calamari .  .  .  . bland and over cooked .  salad with house was as normally expect .  main courses .  .  .  . veal parm with linguini .  .  .  .  . veal and sauce were bland .  sauce was extra watery today .  also had the chicken parm with cavatelli .  chicken was ok at best ,  same runny sauce .  normally have a fantastic meal here .  .  .  .  . pretty disappointed today . 
__label__4 surprised the avg .  rating for this restaurant isn ' t higher .  very solid and consistently good / great food along with a menu that will please even the pickiest of diners . 
__label__5 this is the best italian restaurant in the cleveland area .   my wife and i have been coming here forever and not once have we been disappointed .   oh and the bread with the seasoned butter is simply awesome . 
__label__4 stopped for dinner tonight .  kabab station has been open for four months and serves middle eastern cuisine .  this is a true hole in the wall with extremely reasonable prices .  sandwiches are $4 and dinner plates are between $10 - 13 .  portions are extremely generous - be prepared to take plenty of leftovers home .  or better still ,  eat family style so that you can sample more of the menu .  we ordered the mixed grill  ( 4 skewers of kababs - beef ,  lamb and chicken tikka ,  rice ,  salad and pita )  ,  lentil soup and kibbe .  once we took our first bites ,  neither husband nor i could pause long enough to take pictures between shoveling forkfuls of rice ,  melt in the mouth kababs and soup into our mouths .  i flashed back to childhood and sharing a bowl of ice cream with my sister ,  each one of us swallowing large spoonfuls as fast as we could .   ( brain freeze ?  who cares about brain freeze when the alternative is your sibling eating one more bite of ice cream than you ?  )  om nom nom nom . 
__label__1 ordered on grubhub thought we would try something new .  was trifling disappointed when it took 4 hours to get our food .  call after the first 2 hours of waiting they claimed they just got the order .   called again am hour later and said the same thing .  when we finally got our food it was not only over cooked bit yet some how cold .   none of the food we recorded was even edible .   not to mention packaging was garbage might as well have just wrapped all our food in old newspapers . 
__label__5 my boyfriend and i go out for breakfast every saturday .  we went here for the first time ever a few weeks ago and have been back every week since .  the food is so good and the service has been excellent also .  the greek omlet ,  homefries and blueberry pancakes are awesome .  i have also been told the gyros are good too . 
__label__5 i have nothing but praises to sing chick-fil-a .   this airport location was a great surprise on my way out of town .   i got through the line of cfa fans quickly and the turnaround time for food was also quite quick .   service was great ,  everyone was so friendly .   there ' s also a nice little food court area where there is plenty of seating and large windows so you don ' t feel like you ' re in a bomb shelter like the rest of cle airport . 
__label__3 this place is really hit and miss for me ,  but dang ,  is it convenient !   they do have a pretty good salad bar with lots of fixins and several dressings .   they also have pre-made salads that are good but a little pricy .   the grill is also pretty reliable ,  with burgers and such ,  as is the deli counter .   the sort of  ' iffy '  areas are the pizzas ,  the entrees ,  the soups ,  and the rotating ethnic-food-of-the-day counter  ( pasta bar ,  stir-fry ,  burrito bar ,  etc .  )  .   there is a pretty good selection of grab and go items ,  such as the aforementioned salads ,  pre-portioned fruit cups ,  yogurt parfaits ,  veggies ,  and $4 sack lunches  ( deli sandwich ,  fruit ,  homemade chips ,  and a cookie )  .   oh yeah ,  i almost forgot ,  there is a mini starbucks with desserts but when they are busy no one is working it .   be warned ,  they do get very busy around noon ,  but if you get there at 11:30-11:45 it ' s not bad .     they are open for breakfast but i haven ' t been . 
__label__1 the only reason i go to cafe 1845 is because i work in the same building and it ' s convenient .  however ,  the food is mediocre at best on a good day .   most of their business comes from the pnc building probably for the same reasons .  it ' s convenient and it ' s something to eat .  that ' s really about it !  sadly they really lack in everything else .  not one thing i have ever gotten there has really  wow ' d me .   the employees dress like professional chefs ,  but be advised that they are not even close .  let ' s start with the pizza ,  again for 3 dollars a slice ,  you can get much better pizza elsewhere downtown for even cheaper .  the pizza crust is horrible ,  sauce is not great and  some of the specialty pizzas they come up with just simply do not work .  the homemade potato chips are way over cooked to the point that they just are not good at all ,  which is a shame because the seasoning they put on them isn ' t bad .   the rest of their food is either too salty or no taste at all .   when people voice their concerns about the food ,  they are told that many customers like their food the way they make it ,  and they refuse to change anything .   i know quite a few people who have complained about the pizza crust and the burnt chips .  but nothing changes .   the management has their head in the sand and only seems to listen to the select few that actually like it .   when i inquired about the burnt homemade potato chips ,  i was told that many of their customers like them that way ,  which i believe to be simply false .  because there isn ' t anybody that i know that likes burnt potato chips .  there ' s a reason why no other restaurants serve burnt chips ,  that ' s because they aren ' t good !  cafe 1845 really needs to start listening to their customers if they want to keep in business .  if the pnc building were to close down ,  cafe 1845 would go right along with it ,  because the only reason why they get decent business is because it ' s convenient for the people in the building ,  it ' s food to put in your stomach to last you till dinner .  that ' s all !  if you want a good tasting lunch ,  do yourself a favor and go elsewhere . 
__label__1 absolutely ,  unapologetically bad !   this place couldn ' t have been worse if they were trying to fail as a restaurant / event venue .     we booked ahead for a large group ,  and were subjected to construction workers from next door and vagrants off the streets eating and sharing the buffet we had ordered for our group .   with the owners '  blessing !   seriously !   beyond that ,  the food was absolutely horrific !   i can ' t imagine a reason why anyone would ever want to eat what this establishment argues would pass for food .     i don ' t know about most people ,  but over-cooked reheated leftovers at $10 / plate for a party of 150 people  ( coupled with an incredibly understaffed and dirty establishment .  .  .  )  doesn ' t define an enjoyable family event to me .    terrible ! 
__label__3 you can do a lot worse than massimo ' s on the near west side .   then again ,  massimo ' s could do a little bit better .   the food itself is good .   it won ' t wow you ,  but it ' s not bad .   this place looks like something amazing ,  though ,  so i was disappointed when i actually ate here after walking by it many times .   i don ' t know what else to say .   it feels a little cold inside ,  more spiritually and existentially than literally . 
__label__1 i called and booked a reservation for the foundation room and spoke to a gentleman .  i specifically stated i am not a member of the foundation room but asked if i can still eat there for restaurant week .   the gentleman stated no problem because it ' s restaurant week .  he confirmed the reservation for 6:30 .  when i arrived at 6:27 i was greeted by a woman who stated she could not find my reservation .  i explained i just made the reservation earlier that day and maybe it wasn ' t in their system yet .  i then explained i made the reservation with a gentleman and asked if she could check with someone .  she advised she doesn ' t know who i ' m talking about .  i asked if i could go upstairs and speak with someone as there must be a mistake .  she said no !    i can ' t believe the incompetence displayed by this business .  it was a truly disappointing experience . 
__label__4 very cheap ,  kinda run down booths with minimal leg room ,  great coffee ,  quick service ,  noisy ,  always has two kinda of hot sauces ,  and worth going to to try .  i really like their breakfasts ,  though sometimes the gyro meat for breakfast isn ' t the best there are times it is really good ,  it ' s a hit or a miss . 
__label__5 i order from gus ' s usually weekend mornings there service is quick and there pretty good thumbs up !  if your looking for almost home cooked breakfast lunch or diner this is the place ! 
__label__4 i stopped by on my way through cleveland and must comment from a travelers perspective i will stop again !   got in quickly ,  services was great ,  standard food  ( traditional )  and clean restrooms !  ! 
__label__5 when i wrote my previous review of the mcdonald ' s on carnegie and 30th ,  i recommended driving across town to go to another mcdonald ' s ,  but i didn ' t know about this one .    this one is consistent and while it ' s often busy ,  they keep the line moving .   they are polite as well .   i don ' t know how late they are open ,  but i know i got food here around midnight before ,  so that ' s convenient too .   so yeah ,  this is the mcdonald ' s to go to if you ' re on the east end . 
__label__4 $2 . 75 stroh ' s .   chill dive bar with normal town folk .   they give you a bowl of chex snack mix which is yummy .   they have a big old tv they like to play black and white movies on .   music tonight was dub step .   interesting combo with the movies . 
__label__1 i had a table for 1; however ,  half way thru my meal ,  i found a big cockroach on the table .  .  .  . the waiter / owner apologized when he brought me my check .  .  .  .  . never again .  .  . 
__label__4 try the chicken 65 ,  samosas ,  n biryani .  yum !  best authentic indian food place i ' ve had in cleveland so far .  don ' t let the look of the place fool you .  diamond in the rough . 
__label__5 still love this place .  i ' ve been ordering takeout from here a lot because i ' ve found the perfect dinner for my boyfriend and i to share for under $20: mild chicken korma  ( it ' s a little more medium ,  in my opinion ,  bear that in mind )  ,  samosas  ( spicy ,  delicious ,  some of the best i ' ve had )  ,  naan ,  rice .  i want them to start a bike delivery service in ohio city / detroit shoreway ! 
__label__1 overpriced !  !  !  i believe you could get the same quality from a can for a fraction of the price .  staff is friendly but they kinda have to be because of the cost .  i honestly believe that progresso soup might actually taste better . 
__label__5 i lovvvvvvvve the souper market .  they try there best to use everything local or non gmo .  my only complaint is the one on lorain is always sold out of their amazing grilled cheese .  stock more grilled cheese !  !  !  ! 
__label__3 nice staff ,  i had gotten gel nails and was looking to match a salon pedicure ,  instead i had gel mails that changed with temperature and my feet were a completely different color when my hands got warm  ( pink to red )  .  it was interesting ,  but not for the event i needed this to be done for .  in general staff were nice ,  but wish i could have just gotten what i was looking for .  .  . 
__label__5 i do not live in parma ,  infact ,  i live about 20 minutes away from it .   my coworkers told me about godmothers pizza and how good it was ,  so after work one day i stopped by to try it .   i didn ' t know at first that it was a carry out only place ,  but when you walk in ,  you figure that out pretty quick ,  no tables or chairs .   so i ordered a medium mushroom pizza .   all i have to say is awesome !   i have not had sauce like that in a long time .   plus the cheese combination is different than most pizza places ,  heavier on the parmesan side ,  which is delicious .   needless to say ,  when i got home ,  i had already eaten half of the pizza in the car and wife was not to happy .  .  .  oh well ,  it was to good to wait .   since then ,  i have been back about 7 times and loved the pineapple and jalapeif1o pizza !   even though we live out i the way ,  whenever there is a talk of pizza ,  i drive out there to get it .   they really need to open more locations or change spots .   if they were on the west side ,  they would have so much business .  .  .   definitely worth the drive .   try it for yourself . 
__label__1 we ordered the margherita pizza  ( 40 pcs )  .  the man at the counter was not helpful and actually rather rude .  he was extremely stingy about giving literally five paper plates and some red pepper even though we made a $30 purchase .  he actually yelled at another employee in front of us since she offered us condiments .  he charged us an extra $1 for a pinch of chili flakes .  to top it off ,  the pizza was awful .  you can ' t really call it pizza .  it was more like a big piece of dry garlic bread  ( there was no sauce and barely and cheese on it )  .  we will not be going back .   oh and also if you buy a bottle of pop and ask for an empty cup they will charge you $1 .  some of the most stingiest things we ' ve seen happened here .  good luck getting napkins . there is no indoor seating and it ' s probably for the best . 
__label__1 no no no no no no !  i ' ve eaten here twice .  once when i was drunk  ( anything tastes like prime rib when you ' re drunk ,  especially soggy greasy food )  .  so we ' ll talk about my sober service .  whatever ,  the food is typical for a fast food restaurant .  they have burgers ,  dogs ,  tots ,  and salads for the whacko ' s that are willing to pay a fast food joint to make your salad .  the people rolling out on skates are friendly ,  nothing special other than their footwear .  so yeah ,  my brother and i eat our food .  no sooner do we roll towards wendy ' s to turn out on broadview does he tell me to pull over and stop because he doesn ' t feel well .  long story short ,  we both hurled right infront of marc ' s because the food didn ' t settle well at all .  i later found out why when i met a girl at school who used to work there for a while  . she explained how the people in the kitchen are jerks .   ( you ' ve seen "waiting" right ?  )  yeah ,  picture that in the sonic food prep area .  nasty .  i will never ever ever be back ! 
__label__4 way more fun visiting sonic as a backsliding vegetarian .  roxy and i got the bacon cheeseburger ,  chili cheese tots and a lime chiller ( which is like a shake )  .  the burger was better than the whopper i had a few weeks ago ,  but not gourmet like the thick kind you get at a bar ( aka arm sandwich )  .  the tots were great !  never been a fan of tots ,  but tonight they hit a home run .   speaking of baseball ,  shin soo choo should live out here .  drunk driving is not only tolerated ,  but encouraged in parma .  it ' s like their version of triathlons .  drink ,  smoke and drive !  the service was very friendly ,  quick and sadly ,  not on roller skates .  great way to break in the summer ! 
__label__1 every time i go here they mess up my order .  i ordered a squirtle this time and they gave me a jigglypuff and we took it back and the manager came out and said "you ordered a jigglypuff ,  i was standing right next to him when you ordered" and i said " no ,  i made sure i said squirtle because last time i ordered it you gave me a turtle milkshake" and they were so rude about it .  it took two people to come outside before they gave us the drink we wanted .  one time ,  we were there for an hour before we got our drinks delivered .   ( my friend and i like to go there to hang out when we have time )  .  i don ' t care if they are riding on roller blades ,  this service is incredibly slow and the staff is horribly rude !   and my drink smells like a fart ,  good job guys
__label__5 only reason i ' m giving this pet store 5 stars is because as a small child i came here almost every day when i ' d come to ohio to visit my grandma .  the cutest little puppies ever .  i don ' t agree with the living situation they are in at all in these tiny little cages that are usually for reptiles .  not good for any small puppy to be kept in a confined space .  the man who appeared to be the owner was very kind and answered my questions and was friendly . 
__label__1 overall service here is horrible !  !  !  !   food way over priced  .  .  .  .  . we had a group of 20 and we all were unhappy with everything .  .  .  .  never will come back here !  !  !  !  .   never ever again .   the manager didn ' t even come over to recognize us .   don ' t waste your money . 
__label__5 my wife and i had brunch at adega after staying at the hotel and absolutely loved our meal and experience .  the restaurant is beautiful and elegant ,  yet ,  very cozy .  our waiter  ( matt r .  )  went out of his way to make us feel comfortable and we could tell he had a genuine enthusiasm for both the hotel ,  and cleveland .    as for the food .  my wife chose banana foster ' s pancakes and i wish i could share a picture of what they looked like .  she only finished about 1 / 4 of her plate .  i went the more traditional route of eggs ,  bacon ,  potatoes ,  which were also good .  they didn ' t have a "wow" factor ,  but i would never expect eggs ,  bacon ,  and toast to make me say ,  "wow . " the bacon was great ,  though .    i would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone .  if brunch was this good ,  i can only imagine how awesome dinner would be . 
__label__5 the absolute best service !  !  !  !  !  lane is awesome ,  definitely request him !  we had a big group for st patrick ' s day brunch and had the corned beef poutine special which was to die for .  our server lane took exceptional care of us .  i highly recommend . 
__label__5 we have a great experience every time we go .  our waitress was courteous and continuously checked with us for our drink orders .    even when we have opted for bar service the bartender answered our questions about drink options and was friendly as well as attentive .  the atmosphere is engaging and it ' s easy to mingle with others . the rooftop views are spectacular . 
__label__2 lots of vegetarian options here .  but the menu logo is wrong is several spots  ( a ham appetizer is labeled "vegetarian" but a veggie quinoa bowl is not ?  )    unfortunately the food is disappointing .  the nutella pancakes were dry and too big for the plate .  the eggs any style were boring .  the adega burger ,  i ' m told ,  was a weird mix if flavors .  and the service was very spotty: friendly but inattentive . 
__label__5 was in cleveland for a week .  ate at different places each day .  by far this hotel 9 and their adega restaurant was superb .  food  and atmosphere gorgeous .  my waiter ,  mitchell ,  made my solo evening so refreshing .  had the spinach mushroom ravioli .   very good . 
__label__1 i normally don ' t write reviews but i was so disapointed with adega ,   i will not go back there again .   the two hostess were not very friendly and clueless .   didn ' t know how to treat the upscaled guest .   we spend over $900 and we had to wait for drinks .   for the money you are spending , the food isn ' t that great .    i was very disappointed .   3 ppl order the same pork dish and it came out very different all 3 time .   we ordered desserts and they tasted like they were sitting on the counter all day .   no one came over to ask us about the service .  the waiter seemed overwhelmed .   we wanted to add one more person and they told us they couldn ' t accommodate us .   we had to send one of our business partners away .   now looking back ,  we should have took our business somewhere else .   that really pissed us off expecially since we waited there for over an hour for our table and there were empty tables available .   they could have sat us at two tables or give us other options .  i know it ' s a new restaurant but they need a lot of work if they want to compete with great restaurants downtown .  if you are looking for a great restaurant go to xo or red before adega .   it ' s a shame that the restaurant doesn ' t compare to the hotel and the vault .   we had a great time at those places .   this is actually my 3rd time at adega and the other time i was impressed either .   2 people sent their steaks back and they still didn ' t get it right .  to top off the night ,  you would think spending $900 would get yout parking validated .  well ,   it didn ' t .   also ,  when they did bring our car ,  it was completely covered with snow and the valet attendent didn ' t even bother to clean the car off a little .   it ' s called common courtesy .   i hope they get it together  !  !  !   so dissapointed !  !  ! 
__label__1 deplorable service .    normally when i write reviews i ' m as objective as possible when reviewing service and servers due to extenuating circumstances that may pop up .  i hardly ever leave bad reviews or 1 stars because i really believe that if you have nothing nice to say to don ' t say anything .    unfortunately my review starts and ends with the horrible service i received from the server .   i came with a small group of friends for a bite to eat before the game 7 of the nba finals .  unfortunately from the moment we walked into the empty restaurant and informed by the manager that we would be the last people allowed in due to crowds i knew this was going to be a bad experience .  we were also informed that drinks would take 15 minutes and food wasn ' t currently being served .   drinks were never served to us in that time .  we took a seat on the empty patio and waited 15 minutes before i walked into the bar to place an order instead .  the bar area was filled with maybe 30 people and the bartender was barely able to keep up with the drink orders .  i waited another 10 minutes before giving up and going outside to leave .  however the rest of my party finally found a rude server to place our order .  we then tried to move to a better seat in the completely empty patio to get a better view of the tv in the bar to watch the game tip off .   long story short we waited another 20 minutes to get our drinks .  we waited another 10 before we could place an order for food from the horribly rude and belligerent server who thought it was okay to belittle our order and mock my sister with celiac disease .   we ended up waiting another 10 minutes before we walked in ,  spoke with the manager to cancel our food and paid for our drinks in cash before we left .   needless to say we won ' t ever be back . 
__label__5 take a seat and hear my little  ( like ,  elf-little )  ,  short story of winning:   i got a $20 gift certificate from johnny mango for using my rewards card .   we went for taco tuesday tonight ,  got 11 tacos ,  9 beers and a tab of $29 .  we spent $9 with a $10 tip .    booyah !  love me some jmango ! 
__label__4 this just opened at the old ink spot store at westgate .   this is one of those it ' s really cool places that let you make your food the way you want to .   the concept is this:  you get your dish  ( only one size )  you pick your fro-yo and you pay $ . 45 per ounce .   there are sorbets ,  sugar free ,  and even kosher choices .   you pump as little or as much as you want from the very clearly marked flavors  ( it ' s all low fat fro-yo )  then you pick your toppings from a variety of sweets ,  healthy ,  or fruits ,  and things like marshmallow creme .   they weigh ,  you pay ,  you eat . 
__label__4 i ' ve to a menchies before in california ,  its the same concept as a pinkberry- many different flavors of yogurt and lots of toping ranging from chocolate to fruit and typical to atypical  ( like captain crunch )  .   i ' m a big fan !   the only think they need to do better is monitor the children  ( i understand that should be the responsiblity of the parent ,  but we all know it usually doesnt work like that !  )  that come for ice cream .  i watched 2 children stick their fingers in the ice cream dispenser ,  then their mouth and then do it again to a few different flavors- and that ' s really gross !  !   and the kicker is  they provide sample cups to everyone ,  so no need to use your fingers ! 
__label__4 what can you say about a place like menchie ' s ?  !   there is a good selection of soft-serve frozen yogurt flavors ,  and as far as i know ,  none of them have any artificial sweeteners  ( read dr .  mercola ' s great book titled  ' sweet deception '  for some great info on the dangers and politics of artificial sweeteners )  .   the fro-yo also contains probiotics to improve your digestive function and boost immunity ,  and has much less fat content than ice-cream .   of course ,  that  ' plus '  can easily be negated at their toppings bar ,  where you can find just about anything from whipped cream to heath pieces to maraschino cherries to butterscotch ,  marshmallow ,  or chocolate syrups .   there are fresh fruits available as well ,  to their credit .   but i can tell you that kids love to pile on the toppings as if they were enacting a scene out of a willy wonka movie ,  so keep an eye on them if you don ' t want them to end up looking like augustus gloop !   the only thing i don ' t like about menchie ' s is that they need to maximize their interior seating scheme .   they only usually have a few tables scattered about ,  and when it gets a bit crowded ,  many patrons are left standing .   a few booths with a few extra seats would be nice .   as to a previous poster ' s assertion that at times you don ' t get a greeting from the staff ,  i find that laughable .   who cares ?  !  i go for the excellent fro-yo ,  not to be greeted .   but greet they usually do as well !   the staff is always helpful and friendly otherwise . 
__label__4 after reading mixed reviews ,  i didn ' t really have high expectations for menchies so when i saw it ,  i was impressed !  i didn ' t realize that menchies was a chain that started in california .   it was super cute !  i loved their cute little logo !  and the spoons were too cute to throw away !  they should totally have some type of recycle program for them  ( um ,  not as in rewashing and reusing ,  but some kinda recycling .  berry chill in chicago had a program like that )  and the employees were really friendly !   menchies is a self serve froyo place that charges 45 cent per ounce ,  comparable to other places .  they have a points card where you can get $5 off when you get 50 points .    as far as the froyo itself ,  it was a little watery ie maybe not cold enough ?  it seemed as though it was melting .  it was tasty enough that if i lived in cleveland i would probably visit there often .   the only thing is that i didn ' t see any mochi in the toppings  ( although i admit i was so busy looking around the place that i didn ' t really look hard for the mochi so it may have been there and i just missed it )  .    in case you ' re not familiar with the area ,  menchies is located in the westgate shopping center .   i thought that their products were a cute addition to the place and i liked the idea of their prepacks .   i didn ' t get a chance to buy one so i ' m curious to see how it tastes as a prepackaged deal but just the idea itself seemed genius !  who wouldn ' t want to take froyo home with them ! 
__label__4 the ribs .  get the ribs .    had lunch there today to check out e .  4th ' s newest addition and was happy i did .  the ribs have this amazing peppery rub and were melt in your mouth good .  i appreciate the simplicity of the menu- lots of good drinks and such ,  but just good classic bbq done well .  had a bite of the brisket and that ' s definitely on my list for next time .  and for any clevelander who has a thing for bertman ' s stadium mustard ,  you ' re gonna love the house bbq sauce on the table that uses the mustard as a base .    service was fast and courteous and the atmosphere is great .  definitely going again .    only thing keeping this from a 5 star was the baked beans .  they weren ' t bad ,  but just kind of flat on flavor .  was hoping to be wowed but missed the mark .  i should have ordered the potatoes the guy next to me did .  those looked delicious . 
__label__4 stopped for lunch .   service and atmosphere were great .   food was good ,  but not michael symon ' s usual fantastic . 
__label__4 beer is excellent .  the new haven style pizzas are also excellent .  the saucy style pizzas are unfortunately not good .  the only reason they ' re not good is that the oven seems set for new haven style and they load toppings  ( way too much cheese and sauce )  on the saucy style and cook them at the same speed / temp .  result is undercooked ,  overcheesed and oversauced pizza .  their sauce isn ' t something to write home about either .  if they fix the pizza ,  it ' s 5 stars all day; again the beer is dope . 
__label__2 if you want to stand in line .  be treated slightly rudely and sit on picnic tables with dirty menus and paper towels .  this place is for you !  this place is work !  for you !  you have a very long line for beer and the pizza can get very expensive if you order too many toppings .   might try again in the fall when the dust settles .  they need to try to hire some staff that actually want to work !  like work behind the bar and pour beer in a fast pace ! 
__label__5 the beer line is incredibly long ,  but the pizza is wonderful !  try the bees knees one for sure . 
__label__3 cool place  ,  but there was only one line for drinks and it took along time to order .    the beer was decent but would have been better if i didn ' t have to wait over a half hour in line .  the pizza is uneventful .  not sure if i would go back maybe if they got more beer selection and more registers for ordering . 
__label__5 i live across the street from fuel coffee bar ,  and i ' ve got to say ,  i love their coffee .  the owner dave is super rad .  the staff is amazing and i love how convenient it is .  prices are good ,  abs pastries come mostly from the famous corbo ' s bakery .  what more do you need ? 
__label__5 my family and i decided to go for a drive on the eastside of cleveland when my siblings and i were in town over easter .  after looking for a parking spot in little italy we decided to pay to park at fuel and walk around the neighborhood .    when walking back to our car my sister and i saw the sign that said "the best coffee in cleveland" .  my sister and i are pretty big coffee fans so we bought a americano .  the owner was around and told us about the decorations and how he found most of them on ebay or at antique stores in the area .    my dad also loved the hot chocolate he got .  he said that it was one of the best he has had . 
__label__5 fabulous hospitality ,  consistently good food ,  and a welcoming vibe makes this place my must visit . 
__label__5 awesome shop ,  great prices and very helpful staff !  stopped in and picked up a few figures that were really reasonably priced ! 
__label__5 i went today during my lunch break for the st .  paddy ' s day special .  ghada was super friendly .  the location was really clean and inviting .  my corned beef was amazing .  even though the place was absolutely packed ,  my order was ready within 5-10 minutes .  the coffee i got was also delicious .  the price is so reasonable for the quality of the food .  all around amazing deli place and i ' ll be adding it to my rotation of lunch places ! 
__label__4 this place looks great and the employees are nice the food is a little expensive just as a heads up if you substitute your side for anything it will cost a dollar fifty more . 
__label__5 love this place .     great breakfasts !  !  fast ,  affordable and delicious !  !  ! 
__label__4 so many places downtown to have lunch .  one day i ' ll have tried them all ,  but for today i tried al ' s .    i went in thinking al ' s deli was just that ,  a deli ,  but having seen the menu board there is so much more .  many of my favorite middle eastern options were listed such as fattoush ,   shawarma ,  and shish tawook .  i ' ll definitely be back to try one of those .    but since i was in deli mindset i had to get a sandwich .  the pastrami sandwich was an excellent choice .  it was surprisingly spicy ,  but just the right amount and came with a choice of cheese; pepper jack went well .  the pastrami ,  apparently house smoked ,  was served on rye with a pickle and a bag of original potato chips .    through june there are coupons posted online . 
__label__5 jess from spice was a dream come true before ,  at ,  and after our wedding .  planning an out of town wedding was challenging at every step ,  but she made the experience incredible !   i ' m late to writing this review ,   ( our wedding was 11 / 14 )  but it ' s better late because i can truly say that our guests are still talking about how much they loved our menu ! 
__label__2 fairly flavorless but it ' s practically in sight of my house so they get my business . 
__label__1 ha ,  looks like i lied when i decided i was done with fuel .  i tried to go there on this sunny sunday ,  emphasize tried .  i even checked the hours online ,  ensuring that it was open .  but lo and behold ,  it was closed .  of course .  who wants coffee on sunday ? 
__label__1 ordered catfish dinner but was given whiting and asked for no sauce on ribs but got sauce
__label__5 i was a little hesitant taking my 2008 audi a4 to a mechanic that wasn ' t at the dealership for the first time because audi ' s are extremely difficult to work on .   however ,  i was more than blown away by how hard gilbert and his staff at dac work .   he was able to diagnose a problem with my vehicle that nobody else could fix .   he went literally out of his way to make sure i was happy .   he ' s not only a great mechanic ,  but a good guy as well .   as long as i ' m in the cleveland area ,  gilbert has a client for life .   i normally would never write a review ,  but felt he and his staff deserve to be recognized for their hard work and great prices . 
__label__5 this starbucks is located inside the lobby of the key center - directly adjacent to the cleveland marriott downtown .  you go down a short hallway from the hotel ,  through a set of doors and the starbucks is on your right .   some times the line here can be long - but there were a lot of staff working and the line went fast .  had a triple shot iced latte with whole milk .  strong ,  tasty and delicious !  just what my brain cells ordered ! 
__label__4 the chicken is to die for and with all those sauces ,  you can relish in them .  cole slaw is just perfect in the amount of mayo .  as for the fries and toast ,  they ' re fine .  but those chicken tenders ,  which i ' m pretty sure are cooked to order since both times i went to the drive through i waited probably around 8 minutes each time ,  are amaze-balls . 
__label__4 i ' d never heard of guthries before their recent groupon offer .    honestly ,  i would never have gone without a groupon as i ' d rather "spend my calories" on things other than fried chicken fingers .   holy moly - these are some good chicken fingers .    i ended up using my groupon on a salad and a plate for lunch the next day .   salad was fresh ,  tasty and a perfect bed for a couple of chopped up chicken fingers .   i ' ll be back  .  .  . 
__label__5 i heard rumors chick fila was going to open in steelyard .  but gutherie ' s came instead .  so without anyone caring i boycotted gutherie ' s .  until a power outage affecting only chipotle next door .  covered in paint stained clothes and starving i went in .  the menu has limited choices so i said i ' ll have what he ordered  ( the guy in front who the server knew by name )  which was a box .  ok the bad first .  .  . the "toast" is white wonder bread fried possibly in lard .  but the rest of the meal was sublime with delicious battered all white meat strips seasoned to perfection and cooked to order .  there is a wait so relax especially at lunch hour when the metro workers with their name tag necklaces arrive but it ' s so worth it .  the cole slaw is good not over salted or drowning in miracle whip .  it may even have been real mayonnaise .  the fries are unfortunately crinkle cut the only thing that made me miss chick fila .  and the secret sauce and by the way i never eat sauce was good to the last drop .  hey it ' s the only gutherie ' s in ohio too .  right here in steelyard !   in our hood . chick fila is so common so suburban .  who needs it ? 
__label__5 i first heard about this place through an ad in scene magazine .  as a lifetime  ' chicken finger fan '  i decided to check it out on my birthday .  i went with a friend who had been a vegetarian for 14 years and had never experienced fried chicken .  we were blown away and have been back so many times since then .  the manager is friendly and everyone seems to enjoy working there .  i cannot recommend this place enough .  the sauce is incredible .  i wish i could figure out how to make it myself !  their social media is really funny ,  too .  @reply them .  .  .  they will answer !   update: their instagram person has deemed me their spokesmodel and had given me a free shirt . 
__label__5 damn good .  even though a lot of their customers are people who don ' t have time to wait in line at chipotle ,  guthrie ' s is always worth the trip down to the steelyard .  it doesn ' t feel like fast food and the folks behind the counter are way friendlier than anyone else serving fast food for a five mile radius .    get a box  ( not that you have a lot of options on this menu ,  )  but do not get the cole slaw .  it is heinous .  instead ,  you can get extra fries ,  another cup of dipping sauce ,  or an extra piece of buttery toast .  it makes the box that much more satisfying .  then ,  take their dipping sauce and mix liberally with frank ' s hot .  it ' s a dangerously good combination . 
__label__5 one of the best fast food chain restaurants .  they actually have a few more options than other chicken finger joints  ( e . g .  raising cane ' s )  ,  but the chicken fingers and the sauce are what really stand out
__label__5 best soup in town ,  i mean this is seriously good stuff .   been going to the market location for 10+ years and now they ' ve branched out with same quality .   blue greens salad is over the top with real blue cheese .   real and fresh ingredients every time .   kids and myself live the pulled chicken but i occasionally mix it up .   just great food and service every time !   filling with the bread for around $5 ,  can ' t beat that ! 
__label__5 i love their lobster bisque best but have never had a bad bowl !  i would suggest soup and salad ,  was not impressed with the grilled cheese .  i love the old lunch counter feel of this location and am happy they ' re  in the neighborhood . 
__label__4 i haven ' t been to this particular location ,  but i have regularly dined at their original location off west 25th street .   all of their soups and salads are scratch made everyday ,  the lobster bisque is to die for !   their bread and dressings are amazing !   definitely a must try ! 
__label__2 my boyfriend took me here ,  and with so many other ice cream places around ,  i doubt i ' ll be back .  he got the whitehouse cherry flavor and didn ' t care for it ,  but i wish i would have gotten that .  i got the mint yogurt flavor ,  and i though it was going to be similar to mint chocolate ice cream .  it wasn ' t .  it was pretty much vanilla ice cream with green food coloring .  didn ' t like it ,  people park like idiots there ,  and with so many options ,  this place did not stand out . 
__label__3 bartender was friendly .   very diverse crowd .   great juke box for reasonable price .   i was with a group of friends on our annual baseball stadium trip .   i don ' t often rank restrooms ,  but the men ' s room ranked as one of the worst of all time .   we ' ve been joking about it ever since . 
__label__1 i will not be a returning customer to nicks based only on the atmosphere .     if the teenage mutant ninja turtles had a hangout ,  it would be this bar .     it ' s disgusting ,  and i ' m a total fan of dives .   and not dive bar on w 6th . 
__label__4 being half japanese ,  i would like to consider myself a connoisseur of all things sushi and ariyoshi fits my standards .   i was pleasantly surprised the first time i ate here  ( which is usually the case when trying out a new sushi restaurant )  .   there is a wide variety of sushi ranging from sashimi to big specialty rolls as well as very tasty food for you non-raw fish eating folk .     if you like to have a drink or two with dinner  ( i know i do !  )  ,  then beware that the drink menu is quite limited .   however ,  there is some good sake on the menu and if you ' re down for a sake bomb or two ,  then by all means go for it  ( and it won ' t break the bank either )  .     to sum it up ,  i would say that this is a great little restaurant with good food for really good prices . 
__label__5 great spot !  the space is large ,  open ,  comfortable .  table seating ,  large bar with stools ,  high tables ,  even a lounge type corner and picnic tables outside ,  so you ' ll find some situation you like .   you place your order directly with the kitchen ,  which i kinda prefer .  get your drinks from the bar .  beer is quite good ,  though i haven ' t had everything .    to be honest ,  i never go to this neighborhood ,  but goldhorn was an intriguing excuse to give it a look .  hub 55 is looking good and i ' m very happy to see this kind of thing popping up with passionate owners and loyal customers .   i currently live in boston ,  where a place like goldhorn would never happen ,  for a number of reasons .  next time i come to town ,  i ' d be proud to take my girlfriend to goldhorn brewery . 
__label__3 nothing spectacular ,  but the price is right and they let you keep your bikes in the room !   a great place to stay when i ' m going to nearby ray ' s indoor mountain bike park . 
__label__4 this is where memories are made .  years from now someone will say back when i was a kid my dad brought me here .  my little sister ' s cone always melted on her t shirt .   this is where an older couple sit alone remembering their first child ,  their first house ,  and all they shared .  the wife hands her husband a napkin  to wipe the ice cream melted on his t shirt .    i have sat here with my collie and my partner .  both are my dearest memories .  now i share a bench or a table with kids ,  young fathers and the old couples .  we mind our own business blind to our accidental table companions .    for a brief period in time we share the pleasant experience of east coast custard .  teens seem to like the concretes ,  kids go for the brightly colored flavors ,  the young parents are the most daring trying new flavors .  we seniors stick to our favorite served in a dish .    this is plain and simple pleasure .  the custard is prepared well and has only one purpose--to enjoy .   if you find fault here maybe you should lighten up . 
__label__5 fantastic !  loved everything; griffin cider burley man was a frosty adult beverage that really hit the spot while sitting outside in the cafi area .  hot green ' s  ( had to order a second serving )  ,  and this is cleveland plate  ( classic kielbasa & spare ribs  ( with spicy porky cabbage )  ,  and finally ,  banana pudding .  .  . all delicious .   service was friendly ,  and food was served hot and quick .  great to sample what cleveland has contributed to the bbq world; a wonderful mustard-based sauce . 
__label__4 don ' t get me wrong the place was great and so was the food .  we really don ' t care for public seating and would rather have a table of our own .  not very intimate for talking .  for the price of the food i thought the portions would have been bigger .  for the most part the menu is al-a-cart .  so ,  small pricey portions and you order a couple of things it starts adding up . 
__label__3 had lunch today at mabels .   everyone working here is super friendly and works hard to make sure i had a great experience .   i was seated at a communal table with about 10 or so other people .   had nice conversation .   everyone was pretty excited to try the food .   i ordered the this is cleveland which came with spare ribs ,  kielbasa ,  sauerkraut ,  and pork belly .   i was expecting this to come out as individual portions  ( you ,  know ,  the way most bbq restaurants do it )  .   all of the above came out mixed together on a single plate .   the 8 or so people to my left had ordered a bunch of food and shared .   i wish i could have shared with them .   i was so disappointed my food came out all mixed together like that .   i also ordered lean brisket and jw potatoes and cucumber salad .   with an ice t .   my bill was $50 .   for lunch .   the lean brisket was overcooked and dry .   the ribs were overcooked and falling off the bone .   the pork belly was apparently mixed in with the sauerkraut .   i couldn ' t tell if it was or not .   so i won ' t comment on it .   the kielbasa was outstanding .   moist on the inside .   had that crisp exterior .   was really good .   as for the sides .   the jw potatoes tasted like it had their mustard sauce on it .   i don ' t like bertmans mustard .   or any spicy mustard for that matter .   i could only eat two of these potatoes .   i ordered cucumber salad .   this was excellent cucumber salad .   the sauerkraut tasted like it was cooked in a mustard sauce as well .   but because of how it was cooked into it i actually enjoyed it .   they have 2 bbq sauces on the table .   the homemade bertmans .   i get it .   its an hommage to the city and represents cleveland .   i don ' t like it .   i didn ' t like this sauce .   the other sauce was a habanero sauce that was too spicy for me .   so i had to choke down the dry brisket with no sauce .   my wife wants to try the place .   so i know i ' ll be back .   i know what not to get next time .   and what to get .   the stack of ribs next to me off the ala carte looked more like what i was looking for .   and i ' ll get the fatty brisket .   no way that can be dry .   if i do go back for lunch i ' ll get one of the sandwiches .   they looked awesome and the people next to me raved about it .   the cheese version was spicy according to him in a good way .   as long as its not as spicy as the habanero on the table i may give that a try .   overall i ' d give it a 3 . 5 .   primarily because 2 / 3 meats i had did not meet my expectations and were dry .   and it was waaay overpriced for what i got . 
__label__5 came for lunch and got a seat outside right away !  the service was great and she offered suggestions on what to get since it was our first time dining here .  the food was excellent and came out really fast- perfect for lunch !  we split the beef brisket which was super tender and flavorful .  we also got sides of spaetzels ,  and broccoli salad .  both were large portions to share and equally delicious .  finished off with the chocolate pudding that had caramel corn and whipped cream on top .  yum !  !  they had a nice selection of draft beers and speciality cocktails .  i will be back again ! 
__label__3 it ' s okay .  food is underwhelming and under portioned for what you pay for it .  everything else is standard restaurant .  no more to say than that ,  about sums up every trip i ' ve taken . 
__label__5 @chefsymon absolutely nails it again with mabel ' s !  my buddy jeff and i spit an order of spie4tzle which was delicious and we both got an order of brisket .  one fat and one lean .  we both loved the lean brisket ,  it fell apart as soon as it touched the fork .  only complaint was the house bbq sauce had a strange mustard taste .  not that great .  other than that it was delicious . 
__label__5 my husband and i dined here for his birthday in mid-august and to be honest ,  i wasn ' t really looking forward to it because i ' m not a huge meat-eater .  wow did mabel ' s prove me wrong .  first of all ,  we were told we ' d have a 30 minute wait which is no big deal on a bustling street like east 4th .  they took our phone number and said they ' d text us when the next 2-top was available - 15 short minutes later we headed back .  our waiter was an absolute doll ,  he answered all of our questions ,  made some suggestions / recommendations and ultimately helped us decide on our dinner order .  we ended up ordering the brisket and pork spare ribs - both of which were extremely delicious .  for sides we split the baked beans with chopped briskey & jalapeif1os and broccoli salad with peanuts & dried cherries  ( which i am still day dreaming about )  .  i can ' t wait to go back and try a few other things on the menu .  important to note: all food entrees come out rather quickly which is an added bonus especially if you arrive hungry .  #foodyoucantrust
__label__4 now this place is good .  not as good as naked bbq in phoenix .   fatty brisket i felt was extremely fatty ,  but tasty none the less .  pig ears were awesome .   the ribs are phenomenal .   i like the mustard / bbq sauce . 
__label__5 wow this place was incredible .  we tried every kind of meat on the menu and they were all simply perfect .  the pickles and coleslaw were an added treat .  the beer list the bourbon list the rye list - - these are all outstanding .  and the prices were quite reasonable .  and the waiters and waitresses were just a plus .  i can ' t recommend this place enough ,  i ' m coming back here again next time i ' m in cleveland for sure . 
__label__5 had lunch on opening day .  very friendly service ,  and really great atmosphere .  pig ears and tail for apps .  both were great ,  had never had the tail before .  kinda reminds me of wings in a way ,  but much tastier .   had the brisket and the taste of cleveland as entrees .  both very good .  brisket absolutely melted in your mouth .  toc was a nice sample of several of their items  sides of pickles and kraut .  both very fresh and a good contrast to fatty meats .  beer list was good ,  had a smoked lager made by platform that is made just for mabel ' s .  like how they do keep things local and incorporate other businesses .  place is a tad pricey  ( toc )  but worth the money .  will not find better bbq around and downtown prices always higher
__label__5 service was very friendly and informative of what i was about to order .   atmosphere was great .  beverage selection is very thorough .   food was delicious .   would go again when in cleveland . 
__label__4 one our favorite neighborhood taverns .  friendly atmosphere ,  consistently good fare and a good value given the large portions .  three great menu items are the asian meatballs as an appetizer ,  the warm brie salad and the pork osso buco entree . 
__label__4 if you are thinking of buying a bike this place is great .  the owner is knowledgeable ,  helpful ,  and a good kinda nuts !  we bought our kids bikes here and he adjusted them ,  and inspected them as a courtesy .  when needing a new bike ,  we will definitely come to this place again .  caution: the owner is a bit of a crazy dude .  cool ,  but nutty like jif . 
__label__5 bro ,  this stuff is pretty good .  my mom and i went out to lunch here .  at first glance ,  i thought the menu was kind of pricy for just a sandwich ,  but you get a ton of really good food for your buck .  i got the chicken sandwich  ( the mr .  martin )  ,  and it was fantastic !  the fries that come with the order are also to die for .    everyone working here was quite nice .  the chef came out to ask how our meals were ,  and we were pleased to tell him that we were very satisfied .  i will definitely be going back here to try out the rest of the menu soon : ) 
__label__5 this place was fantastic !  i really wasn ' t expecting it to be this good but ,  damn !  they use real hand pressed meat ,  not the cheap patties you buy in bulk .  the chef took his time .  our burgers were juicy and delicious !  we had the sampler ,  the hibachi burger and the lee road hobo .  their fries have garlic and cheese and simply melt in your mouth ,  like their burgers .  i mean ,  this place was superb !  a+ service ,   the atmosphere was awesome .  the food !  good lawd ,  we will for sure be back .  thank you for restoring my faith in burgers ! 
__label__4 the key to fully understand black box fix is realize that bbf in not "fast food" .  as i read a number of the other reviews it is clear they were hoping to pay mcdonald prices for morton ' s quality .  the truth ,  as is so often the case lies somewhere in between .    the quality of the food is excellent .  the blend of ingredients is intriguing .  prices are commensurate with that level .  a by product of this level of food is an appropriate wait time .  all in all we felt the prices were very fair .  would we like a few more tables ?  sure !  regardless we ' re going back .  .  . soon .  both of us still want to try at least three other sandwiches . 
__label__2 i went to black box for the 1st time today .  i was sooo excited !  i ordered a soul roll and was so disappointed .  it ' s supposed to be andouille sausage ,  greens and jambalaya .  i had not 1 piece of sausage and 2 little pieces of greens .  the chili sauce was great but i basically had a  rice roll .  i ' ll never order 1 again . 
__label__3 pretty good stuff !  i had the omg sandwich and it was very good !  it had a perfect amount of cheese ,  the chicken was very tender and the shrimp was delicious !    i will say that the garlic fries didn ' t taste like they had garlic ,  but that could be because i am immune to garlic at this point in life if it ' s not drowning my food !  *slight garlic addict here*   my husband got the hibachi burger and it was surprisingly bland .  we were pretty disappointed in the burger ,  but the omg sandwich was flavorful and delicious !   fries aren ' t crispy ,  they ' re more lightly firm / soft .  so if you want really crispy fries ,  they won ' t be for you . 
__label__5 - lovely place !  black owned and operated ,  which makes me proud .  the decor is simple ,  modern ,  clean and easy to navigate .  most people get their food to go ,  but we sat down at one of the several seats they had .  the staff is friendly and you can damn-near see right into the kitchen to watch the chefs work .  i ordered the "omg philly" ,  which is chicken ,  cheese ,  shrimp ,  some amazing sauce and several other amazing ingredients .  it comes with parmesan fries ,  which weren ' t very parmesan-y in my opinion ,  but that sandwich .  .  .  it was freaking awesome ,  filling as well .  there are no plates ,  everything was served in a black takeout box even while eating in .  i loved this place and will surely be here again . 
__label__5 take out place that just moved to lee road .  tried it on recommendation from a friend .  i got the sampler pack which had several different kinds of sliders  ( fried chicken ,  burger ,  bbq )  .  all three were good ,  but the burger may have been the best i ' ve ever had .  been back several times since to order burgers and they all have been fantastic . 
__label__5 few places actually enrich a neighbor and this is extremely hard to do in the lee and cedar rd area ,  but they have truly made an enormous impact on the area !   they specialize in gourmet sandwiches with the omg philly being a must try .   the soul rolls are experience all their own .   i really enjoy the option for veggies instead of fries .   each sandwich is made to order ,  if you are in a rush you have the option to call ahead for your order .   if you are ever in the area ,  you are doing yourself a disservice by not trying the food . 
__label__5 the absolute best burger i have ever had !  i live in cleveland heights and have found some of our area restaurants to have great sounding menus but often the food served is disappointing .  but the black box fix was fabulous .  i had the railroader with the most delicious array of ingredients  - top quality - you can ' t go wrong here ! 
__label__5 this place is amazing !  i was referred by a friend who tasted their food while here for a weekend .    first ,  the food looks amazing .  if you ' re anything like me ,  i eat with my eyes first !  my take out box was a work of art .  my sandwich was nearly placed in the box and my fries were accented with fresh parmesan and parsley .  i also ordered a soul roll and it was steaming hot and looked delicious .    before i get to the taste of the food let me add that the restaurant is in a good location .  although parking can be difficult there ' s usually a spot somewhere in the vicinity .  the restaurant itself is quaint  ( probably not best for large parties )  and very clean !  the decor is nice and the atmosphere  ( and staff )  are warm and welcoming .    the food is amazing !  i purchased the omg philly and it was delicious .  the sandwich is accompanied by garlic parmesan french fries .  they were delicious as well .  the soul roll .  .  .  . oh the soul roll .  .  .  . it was so different yet tasty .  it ' s filled with pork or turkey andouille sausage ,  collards and rice .  then it ' s fried in an egg roll wrapper and served with sweet chili sauce .  overall ,  i was not disappointed .  i will be returning . 
__label__4 solid lunch spot !  !  i came here with my mentor on a friday for lunch .  we both ordered the heights fish and the portions are very ,  very plentiful !   the sandwiches come with fries that are so delicious and they come with a sprinkling of toppings .  it ' s definitely comfort food - lots of calories and plentiful and enjoyable .   it ' s more of a fast casual place where you can order at the bar and sit and eat if you ' d like .    the only puzzling thing is that i wanted to come here for lunch with some friends on a saturday .  .  .  but they don ' t open until 2pm !  i found that to be interesting .  be sure to check the hours to make sure they ' re open . 
__label__1 we went on the wings / tenders special night and all of the dishes we ' re severely overfried and overgrilled .  the chicken was dry and seemed previously frozen .  stay away from the fried pickles ,  they were dripping in greece grease and were soggy .  the service was pitiful .  .  .  made us feel unwelcome and as if we were a burden to them .  i would avoid this place . 
__label__4 pretty decent place for meet-up with friends .  excellent food with moderate prices ,  has a good selection of seasonal beers / drinks .  can get loud inside when a live band is playing ,  has a large patio . 
__label__4 came here because it was walking distance from my hotel and it had a touchtunes .  the food was good and the drinks were cheap .  i came on a wednesday which is taco night and the tacos were only $1 each .  overall ,  a good mix of people ,  tv ' s to watch the game ,  and a nice clean bar . 
__label__1 horrible ,  i ' m very saddened by this as this was my go to breakfast place on fridays as they opened early .  after two bad experiences here i ' ll never go back .  literally i was a regular for over a year and now i won ' t step foot in the place .  my recommendation is to avoid at all costs . 
__label__5 gina and staff provide an atmosphere that ' s hard to beat .  great space both indoor and out coupled with fresh menu selections makes this a must stop tavern . 
__label__1 we stopped in at the grt after a round of golf .  our group was very tired and hungry .  i was looking forward to their pizza ,  which was very good when i had ordered it in the past .  when the pizza arrived ,  i could immediately tell it was very undercooked .  i confirmed that the crust was almost raw by trying to cut into a slice with my fork .  the bartender then commented that it didn ' t look right and offered to send it back .  i reluctantly agreed because i am hesitant to send food back to the kitchen ever .  the pizza came back  ( the same one ,  minus the slices on our plates )  about 3 minutes later .  the cheese was more browned ,  but the crust was still undercooked and doughy - to the point of being able to put a fingerprint in it .  i believe they simply shoved the pizza under the broiler for 30 seconds .  of course ,  it was still inedible .  the bartender offered to have them cook a new one or to order something else .  if the kitchen staff can ' t cook a pizza right than i don ' t trust them to make anything else properly .  without asking ,  they removed the charge for it from my bill ,  which was nice ,  but i would have preferred something to eat besides a few onion rings .   i don ' t expect much from bar food ,  but to try to pass off that pizza twice ,  on what appeared to be an average or slower day ,  was ridiculous - particularly for a place that brags about its great food .   on the plus side ,  the bartender was friendly and poured some strong beverages ,  but next time i ' ll follow grt ' s own advice .  their inadvertently ironic slogan is ,  "it ' s better to eat great food at a tavern ,  than it is to drink at a restaurant . " i ' ll leave it at that . 
__label__1 went to bier market tonight ,  tuesday .   not one other person in the restaurant or at the bar .   my husband and i ordered dinner and waited and waited and waited .   after 14 minutes i asked the bartender / server if our salads would be out soon .   he apologized for it taking so long and said he would check .   he said they had a party of 25 in back .   he never did return and after 20 minutes we just left .   a party of 25 should not be an excuse .   they are a restaurant after all .   will not return .   went over to lapetite triangle and had an exceptional meal and excellent service . 
__label__4 i love coming here on saturday afternoons or early in the evening .  the speakeasy in the basement is a fun novelty when it ' s open ,  but it ' s not in danger of being confused with the sublime velvet tango room .  besides ,  we ' re here for the beer and i ' m way too old to deal with the crowds as the weekend nights wear on anyway .  that aside ,  every time i ' m here ,  i ' m happy .  the setting is good ,  the servers are friendly and knowledgeable ,  and the belgian-heavy beer selection is scrumptious and diverse .  this review is for liquid refreshments only .  the food here comes out of bar cento ' s kitchen ,  so if you ' re interested in eating here ,  check out those reviews . 
__label__4 we came here after shopping at the west side market - it was a hot ,  sunny day and we needed some refreshment !   i was with my boyfriend and his family ,  and we all sat out on the patio for some people watching .   even on a hot day ,  we felt cool under the umbrella and got plenty of refreshing shade .   they have a wonderful belgian beer selection - they claim it to be the best between chicago and new york ,  and i can ' t argue with that .   i actually got a belgian style beer brewed in new york - oops - called ommegang wit ,  and it was delicious .   the descriptions of all the beers are detailed and accurate ,  so you know what you are getting .   and they have framboise on draft !   mmmm .   the food all sounded delicious - we got the pommes frites with dipping sauces "for the table , " along with an order of mussels ,  and the olive tapenade pizza .   everything was really tasty - the fries were amazing .   i hear they are fried in duck fat ,  and they had the most addictive rosemary-garlic flavor .   the white sauce ,  an aioli of some sort ,  was our favorite .   the mussels were fresh and tasted like the ocean ,  but their presentation was a bit .  .  .  . rustic .   they didn ' t appear to have been scrubbed  ( still had sand in them )  and they still had beards attached .   but the taste was pretty excellent .   we also enjoyed the pizza ,  which had a lovely fresh olive flavor ,  and a divinely thin ,  crispy crust .     great food ,  wonderful drink selection ,  friendly service ,  and a pleasant place to relax on a saturday afternoon .   what more could we want ?   worth going for the fries and beer alone ! 
__label__4 omg the pizza was ridiculously good .  didn ' t try any beer but had a drink it was good in flavor but not strong enough for the price .  .  .  over all i would go again ! 
__label__4 if you don ' t like beer ,  more specifically if you don ' t appreciate the higher level of quality in craft beer ,  there ' s really no reason to get out of bed .  you live in a very dark place without hope or joy or irony .  at least from my perspective that is .  .  .   bier markt is a celebration of those finer things in life made from fermented grains and hops .  this belgian brew joint features a rotating selection of 8 drafts and over 80 bottles to choose from .  the majority as you probably guessed ,  of the belgian variety .    the happy hour specials are pretty damn good too .  personally ,  i recommend the $4 pommes frites and the $6 organic belgian burger paired with a duvel .  otherwise ,  bier markt shares a kitchen with the neighboring bar cento ,  so the menu offerings are quite adequate .    gezondheid !   ( a dutch toast meaning: "to your health" )  . 
__label__5 excellent selection of beers ,  great place in the summertime to sit back and relax . 
__label__2 huge puddle of meh .  mussels and frites weren ' t anything to write home about .  .  .  .  draft selection decent ,  really loud atmosphere . 
__label__2 this happened a while back  ( though i wrote the review immediately afterward )  ,  maybe this fellow has received counselling or found the lord ,  but as of october of  ' 08 ,  he had some serious issues ,  please read on:   after a very pleasant evening enjoying draft belgian-style microbrews and a friend ' s birthday party at the bier markt ,  i decided it was time to call it a night and cash out my tab at about 12:30 am .  full disclosure is necessary: i had consumed 7 beers and dinner in the course of 4 1 / 2 hours ,  but as they we ' re about 10 oz glasses of one of their less-alcoholic selections ,  and i am a 200+ lbs man ,  i was not ,  at any point in the evening ,  drunk .  i ' ve gone back through the whole series of events ,  which i am attempting to relate as objectively as is possible ,  and all i can honestly find myself to be guilty of was one poorly-considered wisecrack ,  for which i immediately and repeatedly apologized .    anyway ,  i waited at the far end of the bar for one of the bartenders to get to me ,  and i waited a while ,  which did not seem unusual ,  as it was a busy saturday night .  after a fair amount of waiting ,  i leant in against the edge of the end of the bar ,  apparently upsetting a tray of about 10 napkin-wrapped silverware packets that i hadn ' t seen resting there .  the bartender who was nearest began to pick it up ,  and i said to him ,  "sorry about that .  i guess if you guys had gotten to me about 10 minutes earlier ,  that never would have happened , " using ,  i thought ,  an obviously joking tone .  i ' ll admit ,  it was probably not a particularly funny joke to a bartender under the circumstances ,  though it was not at all confrontational in tone  ( and also a true statement )  ,  but his response: "why don ' t you go f*** yourself ? " seemed more than unnecessarily extreme .  .  .    "what ?  ! " was all i could manage in my shock as a response ,  to which he replied ,  "you won ' t get any more beers here . " as i had previously stated ,  i was by no means intoxicated  ( in fact i am typing this first draft immediately afterward )  ,  but was being made to feel i was some kind of abusive drunk .  after collecting myself somewhat ,  i said ,  "i don ' t want any more beer ,  i ' m just trying to cash out my tab . " to which this gentleman glowered at me and replied ,  "well ,  you ' re going to be waiting a while , " and walked over to one of the female bartenders ,  saying something i couldn ' t hear .  i can only assume he was telling her not to wait on me .  when i did get the attention of one of the other female bartenders  ( who had been providing fine service throughout the night )  ,  i asked for my check and asked what exactly was the problem of the other bartender ,  doing so purposefully well within his earshot .  this was when he reiterated his earlier obscene suggestion as to where i could go and what i could do ,  and actually volunteered that he was one of the owners of the bar !    i was completely baffled at this point ,  how can this man expect to run his business in this fashion ?  at this point ,  i just wanted to get out of the place with my credit card and some shred of dignity  ( there were a number of folks that i ' d just met at the party watching this whole exchange )  ,  so when the helpful bartender cashed out the tab and handed me the folder just as the abusive "owner" was again passing by ,  i took the opportunity to reiterate to him that i had upset the tray of silverware completely by accident and that i didn ' t think that his treatment of me as a customer was at all appropriate .  his response to this statement  ( and i still have trouble believing this part ,  though i was standing there )  was to slap the folder containing my check ,  credit card and receipt ,  then in my hand ,  upward into the air ,  scattering the contents onto the bar floor ,  and storm off like a three-year-old .    after i had located my card ,  receipt and folder on the floor ,  and asked for a new pen as i was unable to find the original ,  i paid my check ,  confirmed with the helpful female bartender that this man was indeed a co-owner of the bar  ( she was predictably disinterested in becoming involved in what it was becoming increasingly clear was probably a regular tantrum of her employer )  ,  and assured her that her tip was not reflective of his abuse .  in fact ,  the two stars that the wait staff managed to salvage in this review ,  in spite of their owner picking a fight with this baffled patron ,  should speak highly of the level of service here .    again ,  all i can find that i was guilty of was a bad joke ,  and at several points i gave this man the opportunity to apologize for his abusive language and behavior ,  at each opportunity he sought only to escalate the confrontation .  in retrospect ,  i can only imagine that he really was trying to get me to take a swing at him ,  which ,  if you knew me ,  is beyond laughable .     despite the fine selection of beer ,  impeccable service from everyone other than the ownership ,  and seemingly pleasant atmosphere ,  i have not and will never return to this bar ,  on the chance that i will be subjected to such abuse again . 
__label__5 great beer ,  great service ,  great food ,  great time .  .  .  .  . every time .   i especially love the mushroom pizza and rare vos on tap !  !  !  !   ** note about the coors comment: that is the draft at bar cento ,  not bier markt .   ( bar cento is to the left ,  bier markt to the right .  kind of confusing at first ,  i know .  ) 
__label__4 party party party !   this was our 2nd stop after a visit to the old angle tavern .   downstairs to the speakeasy is where the party is at !   very mixed crowd and i heard the drinks were good  ( i don ' t drink but i ' ll take everyone else ' s word for it )  .    we partied until about 2am and had a blast .   very fun times and the dj was kind enough to play some of our requested songs .   i ' d give this place 5 stars if the dj had been better at keeping us on the dance floor . 
__label__1 horrible customer service .   they never have ice cream so take it off he menu and system is always down .   now they don ' t have frappes .   someone needs to come fix up this location .   go to the one on ridge road in the plaza they r awesome
__label__1 sigh .  .  . i don ' t know why i even bothered to give this particular location another go after my last visit  ( see previous review )  .  everything went well until the one woman dropped off my food near the curb and i ' m not asking you to do a tapdance for me as you drop my food off to me ,  but a simple smile or acknowledgement would be nice after i politely said "thank you !  have a nice day . " maybe she was having a bad day .  nbd .  checked my food .  .  . no syrup or butter .   .  . a little annoyed ,  but not a huge deal .  park car .  get out in my wildly inappropriate leopard print pajama shorts to retrieve condiments .    wait .  wait .  wait patiently for someone to acknowledge me or state "can i help you ? "  girl eventually turns around after smacking a bag angerly out of her way and gives me a look with no words that clearly states ,  "what ? " .  reaches over for condiments after i politely asked like i just asked her to pump maple syrup out of a tree for me .  hands them to me without a simple sorry ,  eye contact ,  nothing .    i don ' t expect someone to bend over backwards to me ,  nor am i that critical of service .  .  . but body language and attitude are hard to pass up .    my next visit to mcdonalds was at another location .  avoid this one at all costs . 
__label__1 this place sucks !   my daughter broke her phone and went to this location to pick up a replacement .   she is on our phone plan and we have insurance on her phone .   she was unaware of this .   the salesman looked up her account and failed to inform her about the insurance .   instead he told her that the only thing that she can do is pay off the $400 she owes on the broken phone and buy a new one .   afterwards ,  when she informed us as to what happened ,  we told her about the insurance .   we called verizon but they said that there was nothing they could do because the store is an independent franchise .   she returned to the store the next day and confronted the salesman .   his reply ?   "it ' s not my job to inform you that you have insurance . "  on top of that ,  they charged her a $70 "restocking fee" to return the new phone .    ( verizon only charges $30 . 00 )   stay away from this place !  !  !  ! 
__label__2 my experience was that of an excellent education tainted by bullying and intolerance .   in the 1990s i was the son of a poor single mother in the inner city of cleveland .   st .  ignatius admitted me and gave me enough financial aid to attend ,  for which i am deeply grateful .   today ,  partly due to the excellent education they provided me ,  i have earned my ph .  d .  and lead a successful and happy life on the other side of the country .   however ,  their kindness does not excuse the harmful behavior that often took place and which seemed to be part of the fabric of the school ' s culture .   for example ,  while i was a student several of my classmates were bullied to the point of committing suicide ,  such as an acquaintance of mine named owen french .    once ,  when news hit of a different student committing suicide because he was gay and bullied we had an all-school assembly .   administration did not address bullying at this meeting ,  but instead warned the students against talking to the press about the school ' s culture .   i am still in shock today that this was how the school responded to the suicide of a gay student .   i also had a close friend named david snyder who had a visible medical condition .   the word "teased" does not capture the malice and abuse he suffered because of this .   four years of ostracism and abuse took its toll on him and not too long after graduation he would also be dead .   these are just some extreme examples ,  but i can say that in my experience ,  homophobia ,  racism ,  elitism ,  and general xenophobia against anyone different were rampant ,  daily phenomena .   at best this mindset was tacitly approved by the school ' s power structure ,  at worst ,  encouraged by it .     to my knowledge ,  there was no mention of the students who committed suicide in our yearbook or any admission on the part of the school of failure to protect these kids .     i would call on saint ignatius to take responsibility for bullying and intolerance .  i have since been back and i saw a plaque that honors another student in my class who died of natural causes .   someday i hope to tour the school and see a plaque with names like david snyder and owen french conspicuously displayed saying ,  "bullying contributed to the deaths of these students ,  and we will never let that happen again . "  update 10 / 31 / 14 .   if you view the other posts you will see the "nothing is wrong" attitude which is really the root of the problem .   one 5 star reviewer admits ,  "no ,  it is not for everyone" which is all too true- perhaps much more true than he intended to admit .   not everyone is welcome .   he goes on to completely dismiss bullying and intolerance saying ,  "there is no  ' boys will be boys '  attitude in the culture of the school" .   another 5 star reviewer implies that bulling is everywhere so st .  ignatius should not be held responsible .   this is the viewpoint of the powerful majority; of those who fit in and do not face the stigma of being "the other" .   i ' d encourage everyone who denies a problem to ask an actual student to count how many times a day they hear the word "f-g"  ( homophobic slur )  .   when i attended ,  i counted it in the dozens .   blindness to the problem is the luxury of privilege . 
__label__5 it is really difficult to rate a school like you would a restaurant or other venue .   i am not an alumnus ,  but i have had three sons go through the school and i have been involved with their activities for ten years .   the experience was not at all what i expected .   while the school has a reputation for athletics and academics ,  there is much more that makes its special .   there are students from diverse cultural ,  socioeconomic and educational backgrounds .   not every graduate goes on to an ivy league school ,  but they do tend to go on to be successful individuals .   there is no "boys will be boys" attitude in the culture of the school - rather there is an expectation that "boys will be men . "  i have also witnessed an attitude of tolerance towards students .   no ,  it is not perfect .   no institution is .   no it is not the only great school in the area ,  there are several .   no ,  it is not for everyone .   it does instill an attitude of being a team player among its students in it ' s "men for others" philosophy .  it has certainly achieved my goal of reinforcing the values that i have tried to teach my sons at home . 
__label__1 dirty ,  rude staff ,  and has the stylings of a cvs about 10 years ago .  shelves are disorganized and good luck getting help .  skip this place . 
__label__3 i ' m glad this place doesn ' t have a drive-thru .   screw car-oriented american culture .   and screw music kiosks !   i like good-old-fashioned cafes .   plus ,  this place is in a very pretty building; you have to love it for that .   i hate to see old buildings like this one  ( very locally known as "the rockefeller building" ,  not to be confused with any of the other "rockefeller buildings" about town )  lie vacant or be populated with stores that you never go into . 
__label__5 can ' t say enough good things about this restaurant ,  so this will be short: food ,  service ,  ambiance - all perfect !   looking forward to my next visit .   i live in virginia but i will now make a excuse to go to cleveland to visit the museum and especially this restaurant ! 
__label__3 i came here over the holidays when they were just getting started so i hope that since then some of the kinks have been worked out .  i had take out lunch from the cafeteria side of the restaurant and ate out in the atrium to take in the beauty of this new space inside the art museum .  i ate a special grilled cheese topped with sun dried tomatoes - it was delicious !  ordering can be a bit awkward as you have to wait in line to order ,  then again as your food is being prepared .  the food was good but i ' d probably skip the dining hall experience and get lunch before the museum at euclid tavern next time . 
__label__4 provenance at the cleveland museum of art is off to a great start with lots of room to grow !    let ' s start with the great stuff:  atmosphere is chic and modern without making you feel like a pretentious jerk-face for eating lunch there .   ( yea ,  normally my lunch consists of eating miscellaneous items from my fridge in front of my computer .  .  . so what ?  )  i loved the textures in the wall decor and the minimal whites ,  chrome of the tables and chairs and dark grey floors .  but the real showstopper was the festive view ,  featured through the entire wall that ' s a window facing outside !  it ' s nothing crazy ,  but really ,  really natural and pretty with lots of evergreens .  it gives the whole room some warmth and natural tones .  the vibe certainly fit the new atrium of the museum .   the food was super-creative and very tasty !  i loved the ever-changing menu of special dishes made to coordinate with whatever exhibit is being featured at the museum .  but i couldn ' t help but try something off their regular lunch menu--scallops ?  yes ,  please !  perfectly seared ,  served with crunchy ,  roasted kale ,  fingerling potatoes and roasted fennel  ( which i normally hate ,  but loved here !  )  my only complaint was that it didn ' t need the additional olive oil drizzled on top ,  since the roasted veggies already had enough .  the result was almost too oily ,  but not quite .  my very handsome man tried the moroccan spiced chicken and i didn ' t hear one complaint from him as he cleaned his plate .  but my favorite item ?  the roasted garlic soup--i know ,  it doesn ' t sound like it would be interesting ,  but it was amazing .  just try it  ( i almost licked the bowl .  .  .  )    now ,  here ' s where there is room for improvement:  although the service was super-sweet ,  they all seem like they would benefit from a confidence boost .  our waitress seemed to fumble over a lot--like a lot .  i watched her pour a beer for another table and it overflowed everywhere .  she then walked out with dishes from the kitchen and had to turn around because the food moved everywhere on the plate and fell over .  .  .  she didn ' t seem to have a hard time pronouncing anything ,  but she just seemed really uncomfortable ,  as did some of the other servers .  this is something i do believe they ' ll work out after a while .  they ' re new--remember that .    overall ,  i ' d definitely come back for a lunch date at the museum and definitely to try a dinner service .  i think they only have dinner service on wednesdays and fridays from 5-9pm ,  so just keep that in mind ! 
__label__5 lago is now closed but there will be a new wine and cocktail bar in 2013 .    fabio salerno is going to open a new spot in ohio city  and the east bank of the flats .  .  .  loved lago but this is more like a stock split !  !  !  two more awsome restaurants and then something to fill in for the defunct bar 806 .  .  .  .   well played cleveland restaurant moguls .  .  . well played !  !  ! 
__label__3 umm .  .  .  i don ' t know what happened ,  but the food seems to be getting more and more bland each time i go .   its been surpassed by a few places on my list ,  but its still nearby and convenient and really not bad ,  so i ' ll keep going ,  but i wish they didn ' t lose their luster .   maybe its just the other restaurants i tried .    also ,  make sure you always get take out or the buffet .  service is very slow . 
__label__1 i have been to this restaurant several times and have consistently been disappointed .   the service is slow and uncooperative with my requests ,  the food takes far longer than one would expect ,  and most especially the restaurant is filthy .  i had to clean the light switch in the men ' s room before i could even feel comfortable turning it off .  even though the restaurant is still fairly new the carpet looks old and covered with food grime .  we are desperate for a good indian food restaurant in this neighborhood ,  but this isn ' t it .  my partner and i have given it our last chance and we won ' t be back . 
__label__4 went for lunch today ,  parked right in front .  after skimming the menu and seeing lots of interesting choices ,  we both chose the lunch buffet .  stuffed myself silly with two big plates of food and enjoyed every bit of it .  had a mango lassi which was also very good and a balance to the spiciness of the food .  our waiter brought out fresh naan when we asked and was attentive . 
__label__4 yummy hyderabadi chicken biryani and lamb chops !  ambience can be better .  paneer tikka was a disappointment because it wasn ' t kiln fired tikka .  but biryani makes up for everything . 
__label__5 it ' s not the tallest building in the city ,  but it sure has a nice view !  definitely worth it for those new or have never seen it before !  you can find some hidden secrets from up there .   i took a 360 from my nexus 5 here: https: /  / plus . google . com / 116180413887708820086 / posts / 5wxevqs3z5y ? pid=6084999845793775682&oid=116180413887708820086
__label__4 municipal stadium is now known as the cleveland browns stadium ,  thanks to the sin-taxes of cleveland residents .  since this city is a bonefide "football town , " the stadium is usually sold out  ( or nearly sold out )  ,  on every game day .   the game day atmosphere ,  in and around the stadium ,  is unlike any other local pro sporting event that you have ever seen or attended .  each parking lot is filled with tailgaters and browns backers-- who are die hard browns fans .  and it is pure magnificence to see all the fans dressed in various forms of browns gear ,  and the various forms of browns decor on their cars ,  vans ,  buses ,  and trucks .   inside ,  the first thing to catch your eye is the immaculate field ,  the beautiful bright orange seats ,  the beautiful legendary player banners ,  and the current player banners decorating the circumference of the lower and upper bowls .    the atmosphere is electrically charged with a lot of cleveland browns nfl franchise title winning history ,  hall of fame legends and renewed hope that the new owner--jimmy haslem iii--can bring this organization its very first super bowl championship .   if you want to bring your children to a game ,  i suggest that you sit in "the family friendly section" where alcohol is not served--since many fans are very passionate and tend to get very "vocal . "  also ,  if you plan on eating lunch or snacks here--the food is great  ( but pricey )  .  there are a lot of concession choices--ranging from traditional stadium eateries to local iron chef michael simon ' s b spot restaurant and chef rocco whalen ' s gourmet tacos and nachos . 
__label__4 so i ' m a tourist here in cleveland and i ' m checking out the downtown cleveland area and i run across the stadium .  fyi i visited on a saturday .  i found parking on the street ,  which is metered and walked into the team store .  the staff at the store was very friendly and extremely helpful .  the only downside i think to this stadium is that it ' s on the lake front which makes this place windy and cold .  i ' d go to a game here but in september not november but again that ' s just me .  the weather probably adds to the mystic and fan experience . 
__label__3 so i eat here for lunch often !  it seems that the service is declining .   i love the lunch special for $3 .  lately ,   there is no sauce ,  no ketchup .  .  .  nothing !  the staff is too busy joking and playing around in the kitchen to even notice people have walked in to place orders .  i get the wrong food often .  .  . however ,   i ' m glad they changed their fries !  i hope the service gets better .  the chicken bangs !  try it ! 
__label__4 bier markt is a solid choice for a happy hour and it ' s usually not too busy so getting a table for a group without a reservation has been doable on the occasions that i ' ve gone .   happy hour menu is a good deal .   there is usually a  decent selection of drafts and the food is okay for the price .   overall you get what you pay for so the burger ,  pizza ,  etc .  isn ' t anything to rave about ,  but it ' s not bad .   i tried the pizza on the happy hour menu ,  which i would probably skip next time around .   its hard to complain too much since it was only $5 .  i found it especially greasy and the crust was nothing special .   i do like their fries though .    service has also been overall good .   they are able to accommodate larger parties and don ' t seem to have any trouble splitting the checks at the end .  waiters are fairly attentive and they are prompt about getting drinks to the table . 
__label__5 really love this place .  the fries are as good as it gets .   ( it ' s all about the duck fat .  )  the pizzas are bar pies ,  but they are as good as that style of pizza gets .  i ' m normally a red sauce ,  keep-it-simple guy ,  but every "modern" pizza i ' ve had off the menu has been tasty .   ( try the pork sugo pie .  )  great house-cured charcuterie ,  as well .   ( this is the kind of place you want to post up to the bar and share as many small plates as you can stomach .  )  i love the happy hour for those of us who can ' t make the usual happy hour .  .  .  drink specials all day sunday ,  and food and drinks all day monday .  you get a huge ,  shareable plate of fries for $4 ,  and beers with actual flavor for $3 . 50 a glass ! 
__label__5 love this place !  !  they always have great belgian beers on tap !  have done many tastings here .  went here yesterday for sunday funday : )  eddie was our bartender and he was awesome !  he had to kick a couple of drunk rude people out ,  but i thought he handled it well .  their fries are the best thing i ' ve ever eaten in my life !  get extra garlic mayo because you ' ll want more !  i get the fries every time i go regardless if i ' m hungry or not !  also i just found out they are dog friendly ,  so this is going to be one of my go to spots even though i live in westlake .  you won ' t be disappointed ,  go here ! 
__label__2 for a german  ( bier )  beer place you can only imagine my surprise that the house lager is .  .  . wait for it .  .  .  coors .   no ,  coors is not a lager and i even question that it ' s beer .     the inside looked fun and hip ,  but service was poor and slow .   i ' m kind of holding a grudge over the whole coors thing .  .  . 
__label__3 if my rating was solely based on the service and the food ,  i would ' ve given bier markt five stars .  our server was pleasant and on point .  the food  ( i ordered the mushroom pizza with pancetta ,  my husband ordered the spicy chicken pizza ,  and we shared a side of fries )  was delicious !   the reasons i ' m giving it three stars: 1 .  we could not order any draft beers because their beer taps weren ' t working .  huge disappointment for my husband since that was our main reason for going there .  2 .  they were out of the ravioli and the chicken entrees .  i feel like when you only have a handful of options for customers to order from ,  it ' s extremely important to have everything available .  especially since we were there on a monday evening ,  not even on a busy night when it ' s feasible that they sold out of it .  3 .  we saw a lot of kitchen staff coming in and out of the front doors .  not that big of a deal ,  but a little distracting and it did take away from the "ambiance" of the restaurant .    bottom line: food and service were excellent ,  but it probably won ' t be a first choice for us the next time we ' re in the area . 
__label__5 this review is strictly for the bier markt because even though they ' re connected i consider bar centro an entirely different place for an entirely different occasion .    i love bier markt .  it is probably my favorite bar in cleveland  ( i ' ve been to em all )  .  they have plenty of tasty craft beers and all of the staples .  the place is spacious and the crowds are usually all easy going people who are just having a good time so even when it is crowded there is not a whole lot of the "come at me bro" contingent .  i will say one thing we have noticed and talked about with the markt is that the crowd can be entirely different from one night to the next .  one night you can have artsy horned rim glasses type ,  the next you can stumble upon 5 or 6 routy bachelorette parties .  it ' s just a great place .  also ,  as a newly single person in my 30 ' s it is a great place to meet new people without having to wade through the "hey brah" "erie shore" crowd on west 6th .   if you haven ' t been there you should give it a try ,  and while you ' re there you should get a pizza from nearby bar centro .  it will change your life : ) 
__label__5 beer is fantastic ,  staff is friendly ,  and the food continues to be flavorful ,  creative ,  and tasty .  should be a destination for anyone coming to cleveland . 
__label__1 waited for an hour for food ,  and the waitress was very rude ,  never filled my water ,  not even asking if we wanted dessert after ,  clashing all the dishes ,  and when asked for more water ,  she just brought in the water bottle and never poured for us .  food was good but man why was the service so bad !  there were almost nobody here either !  will never be back again ! 
__label__4 i ' ve come in here a couple times for food and a couple more times for just beer !  their beer selection is truly amazing and delicious and filled with all the good things made in this earth .  the bartenders are knowledgeable and helpful with choosing either a brewed drink or a cocktail or whatever libation you fancy imbibing .   i had the happy hour burger which was decent and a good deal .  they have lots of other food items on their happy hour ,  so i would highly recommend coming in and trying everything you can during that time !  i ' ve heard they also have a pretty fun and bumpin dance floor in the basement maybe it ' s on the weekends ,  but i ' m looking forward to checking that out soon .  bar cento shares a kitchen with them next door ,  so they serve i believe the same foods .  the pea pasta was amazing and super fresh and summery and bright ,  i think about that pasta every time i drive by that 2 mile radius .  last time i went they were out of mussels ,  but i swear to thee that i will have those mussels soon or my name isn ' t george washington !  okay ,  my name isn ' t george washington ,  but i really want those mussels .  and i shall have them too . 
__label__5 i got into craft beer about 5 years ago in college .  i like brown and ipas the most .  bier market has the best selection of belgium beers around .  i love the st .  bernardus and the brooklyn ipa .  the happy hour is one of the best in cleveland and the dicor is very fitting for the type of bar .  the food is quite good but i have yet to try those outside of the happy hour list . 
__label__1 cute place but the staff is so rude .  first and last time ever going to that place ,  i hope their staff can get some etiquette classes or at the very least ask their parents why they weren ' t raised with any manners .    there ' s plenty of other places to go to on that street ,   crossing this one off for good . 
__label__4 we went to bier market for a birthday party in the basement .  it was my first time there and i was impressed .  drink selection is excellent ,  service was fantastic .  they have the highest rated pizza in ohio according to zagat .  i wouldn ' t say it was the best i ' ve ever had ,  but it was pretty good .  the crowd was young and hip ,  i would totally recommend checking it out .  you could even play how many hipsters can you spot .  skinny jeans ?  check .  flannel shirts ?  check .  think rimmed glasses ?  check .  hope they have a lot of pbr stocked . 
__label__2 i was so excited to finally go here bc i love crop  but i was very disappointed by the awful service from our bartender .   honestly ,  i could not believe how blatantly annoyed she was to have guests on a friday evening even though the place was not very busy .   she was extremely rude and inappropriate .   my best friend who i was with is a manager at a newer and very busy downtown restaurant and her reaction was ,  "this is the exact opposite of how i expect my staff to treat our guests . "  i haven ' t tipped anyone less than 20% since like .  .  .  well ,  i don ' t remember the last time but i bet she ' s used to getting 5% . 
__label__5 was looking forward to checking out the glorfied munchies approach i read about crop rock ,  and was was not disappointed !   the drinks we got were fantastic and then the shrapnel fries came to the table and blew my mind .  kung-fu fighting "handheld" was complex ,  so i liked it better without the bbq sauce .  on our way out i started peeking around the massive record collection and the dude spinning records came out and was gushing about about when he first saw rick james .   really great night ! 
__label__4 i have been a fan of the beet salad and deviled eggs at crop so it was nice to see those items on the menu at crop rocks .   the crop rocks deviled eggs are the shizz .   smoked bacon and some type of wasabi / horseradish filling that is incredible .   there were smears of what appeared to be sriracha and a sweeter soy sauce on the plate .  .  .  . perfect complements .   the magic carpet ride that night was curry chicken .   delicious flavors on that plate yowza !   very large space ,  almost too spacious for the number of tables .   i feel like they can add more tables .   our server said we should get our orders in because the kitchen was backed up but then our food literally arrived 5 min later .   so i tend to agree with previous posters that there appears to be a lack of communication between the servers and kitchen staff .   great djs spin vinyl from a huge collection of records .   there is a nightclub next door that they keep the door open to so don ' t sit at the table in front of the dj booth unless you want to hear a mixture of dj and club beats .   service was pretty good . 
__label__4 great meal !   we both had different mac & cheese dishes and both were fantastic .   we stayed away from the pastries ,  but from what we saw ,  they looked great !     a great addition to ohio city !  ! 
__label__5 my favorite bar in the cleveland area .  a brew before  ( or after )  a movie at the cedar lee is my favorite ,  but parnell ' s is also a place where you can have a drink with a friend and actually hear the other person .  the staff are all very friendly .  if you ' re looking for a traditional irish pint ,  this is the place to go . 
__label__3 i swear you pay an extra dollar on everything for the atmosphere that only half the establishment has .   granted ,  its a very pretty bar ,  just nothing that i haven ' t seen elsewhere .   decent beer selection and a nice whiskey selection ,  but nothing special .   the only thing is that the fries are the best you can get outside of 4th street downtown .  sublime . 
__label__1 first off ,  good beer selection and just a good "bar" vibe .  not bright ,  not barren on a monday night ,  but a good solid bar .   however ,  when i went there the service was horribly surly .  i got the feeling like we were bothering the server by asking for two beers and an order of fries to go .  and this was on a monday ,  so the place had patrons ,  but it was by no means slammed .    i say save your money and saunter down to o ' neils ,  i loved our time there . 
__label__4 ok bar .  beer were cold and tony the bartender was cool .  good knowledge of the area for out of town people . 
__label__1 this place immediately looks sketchy .  it wasn ' t as bad once we looked inside but it wasn ' t great either .  i will likely not stay here ever again ,  but it wasn ' t horrible .  i suppose it could ' ve been worse .  there is a bar and restaurant inside .  that ' s always a plus .  rooms are outdated and not the cleanest . 
__label__4 been all over the country eating brisket .  this is by far the best .   get the cracklings as a side . 
__label__5 had an amazing time at mable ' s bbq - probably some of the best meat i ' ve ever had in my life .  i loved how simple the concept was and how good the food was .  no sauce even needed !  my wife and i got seated after a two-hour wait .  the coolest thing was that we were able to give our phone number and rome around east 4th st .  and when we were ready ,  they just texted us !  now thats cool !    i loved the decoration inside and out .  it gave a rustic ,  but yet cool feel .  the community table in the middle and the close seating was interesting ,  but a cool experience .    the food was amazing ,  have i mentioned that yet ?  lol .   the only down part is that it was a pretty expensive eat .  this would definitely be a place my wife and i would love to come back and try ,  but only once in while due to pricing ,  which is totally understandable when your making the best meat around .   if you haven ' t had a chance to try out mabel ' s bbq ,  do it !  you will not regret it .  plus .  .  . the food is amaaaaaaaazing !  : ) 
__label__4 the barbecue is really great and the kielbasa  is delicious - both classic and "hot with cheese" are good; i prefer the hot with cheese ,  though it ' s not actually very spicy .  as lover of side dishes ,  i wish there were more options for sides .  overall ,  it ' s a nice place and the service has always been top notch . 
__label__5 service is outstanding .  food is incredible .  smoked to perfection .  everything is ala crate .  great value and quality .  this is a must do when in cleveland .  it is also surprisingly kid friendly . 
__label__3 i was excited to try a michael symons place ,  one of my favorite food network guys .   found the place thanks to my yelp app and was excited for dinner ,  bar-b-que is my favorite .   i will have to say i was disappointed on several levels for the visit .   first off i was traveling for work so i was there by myself .   i found a spot at the bar which was great since there was a pretty good line up to get a table .   bartender was very helpful and i had a great cocktail ,  the loaded cherry coke i think it was ,  was delicious !   my beef  ( no pun intended )  was that the menu is clearly designed for groups and for sharing .   i was really surprised that you couldn ' t get a 2 or 3 meat combo .  .  . this is a bar-b-que place for gods sake .  .  .  . that is what places do ,  they let you try different things .   i tried the fatty brisket which was very good but you had to get a 1 / 2 pound of it and that is too much fatty anything for one person to order .   i would have liked a little with some sausage or some ribs but not a big slab of it .   all the flavor got lost in all the fat .   i guess that is my other beef  ( again no pun intended )  .   i see bar-b-que places as this great little part of the amercian experience .   they are these places run by people that care about the food and the sauces regardless of where you are in the country ,  all the same idea just a different combo of flavors .   this seemed like this joint aimed at the business crowd .   come in ,  order a bunch of stuff ,  expense it and talk about it for the rest of the week .   this didn ' t feel like a bar-b-que place to me .   i ' ll come back when i swing through ,  it was very good .   i ' ll come with work people though ,  a few ,  and we ' ll expense it !   kt
__label__5 i have been to mabel ' s bbq 3 times & all visits have been awesome !  !  all the meat is cooked to perfection .  ordered: brisket ,  ribs ,  turkey ,  cracklin ,  baked beans ,  pudding  ( we tried them all )  i prefer the lean brisket to the fatty .  both are good ,  but the lean is very tender without the extra fat .  the cracklin with the lawson ' s dip is a must have .  it is very flavorful & very crunchy & something that i can not duplicate at home .  the j . w .  potatoes have a crispy & tasty . 
__label__5 so amazing !  took some fam here for lunch .  each bite was so tasty !  lamb ribs killer good and the brisket ,  kale salad etc delicious .  symon doesn ' t disappoint . 
__label__3 not your typical mexican .   that is ok for me and my husband but there wasn ' t even a normal taco on the menu for the children .   despite that ,  they found some things to eat and all of us were happy .   our server was new which led to some interesting moments  ( ie ,  how to pour a serve a beer .  .  .  .  .   ?  ?  ?  she was sweet about it and we are patient )  .   i definitely enjoyed my food ,  it was not typical .  .  .  .  however ,  i ' m not sure if we will go back again or not .   it wasn ' t super special and definitely is not my go -to place for mexican in cleveland .   i am still searching for that place ! 
__label__4 excellent food .  loved all the salsas .  mahi mahi tacos and beer battered avocado tacos were delicious .  what a great little local find . 
__label__4 yum !  they creative sauces and house made chips here are awesome ,  the tacos were inventive and delish ,  and the service was phenomenal .  the owner came out to explain all the dips ,  and when we couldn ' t decide she happily brought them all out to us !  everyone was courteous ,  and they even did a good job of serving us the wine and beers that we brought  ( byob !  )  .    sadly for me ,  i think they are expanding and getting their own liquor license ,  but i ' ll surely be back ! 
__label__1 overpriced  7-floors abm garage .  attached to statler arms apartments but operated separately .   if you are moving in / out statler arms apartments to / from any floor from 2-7 make sure that the vehicle you are using is less than 6 '  height in order to upload / download your forniture from the same floor parking-apartment ( it saves time and effort )  .  otherwise ,  you will park near the dumpsters to take the furniture elevator from the basement to any floor .   the garage rates goes as follow: early bird  $7 . 00       ( there by 8:30 )   ( max: until midnight )   daily           $8            ( from whenever- until ,  max ,  midnight )   ( early-bird and daily passes will be charged extra $ for every 15minutes after midnight )   special events  $20    ( might change )   monthly     $185        ( unreserved )  ( +$40 first payment for the pass )   ( up to date )   monthly      $190       ( reserved )  ( +$40 first payment for the pass )   ( may have changed starting 01march17 )    the garage is used by hotels in the area for their valet services so the $185 monthly passes might not find a spot in there sometimes especially when there is a sporting event in the nearby progressive field . 
__label__2 i was excited to hear this location was opening again ,  so we decided to try lunch there after a long morning .  it was very dark and dreary in there and it didn ' t feel very welcoming .  it definitely didn ' t remind me of the damon ' s i used to know .  our host forgot a kid ' s menu and when i asked him for one ,  he took away my menu so we were one menu short .  when i asked him for the menu back ,  he looked at me like i was crazy .  our waitress was unenthusiastic and lacked any sort of personality .  i don ' t think she smiled the entire time we were there .  we all ordered burgers and they were okay .  .  .  not terrible ,  but not amazing either .  the fries were really good though !  i definitely won ' t be visiting this restaurant again .  i wasn ' t impressed with the re-opening .  .  . 
__label__4 we had a party of 15 there today ,  celebrating the families january and february birthdays .  we had a real good time .  the service was great they took real good care of us and the food was good .  the only thing i heard was the order of prime rib was a little more than med .  rare ,  but it was real good tasting .  we will be back . 
__label__3 they met expectations .   order was ready when they said ,  and tasty pizza .   my son ' s new favorite . 
__label__1 ordered delivery ,  and after waiting an hour after the projected 40 minute wait time ,  i called the store .  the lady on the phone told me the driver left the building and my order was on its way .  about 17 minutes later ,  the driver called to say he was at my house  ( he wasn ' t )  ,  but then about 30 seconds later someone with a loud stereo blaring ghetto rap pulled in .  he didn ' t bother to turn down his stereo when walking up my driveway ,  either .  my order was missing sauces i paid for ,  my pizza was missing the roma tomatoes i paid extra to have .  i won ' t even bother calling the store directly to complain .  what a waste .  not ordering from here again . 
__label__5 dorothy perelman from private lodgings has managed the rental of our single family home in university heights for over 10 years .   she has been no less than outstanding in every single way !   she ,  and her business partner carl ,  have provided the following services for us: advertising and showing the property ,  screening and securing tenants ,  overseeing standard maintenance of the home  ( e . g .  ,  minor repairs ,  painting ,  carpet replacement )  ,  and overseeing major repairs of the home  ( e . g .  ,  roof repairs due to ice storm damage )  ,  among other things .   dorothy has strong relationships with local contractors which results in her being able to secure fair rates from honest companies .   moreover ,  she seamlessly handles everything from start to end of the process ,  which has been extremely helpful for us given that we live out of state .   she is conscientious and reliable in everything that she does .   moreover ,  she is a kind and generous person who takes personal pride in providing good service and maintaining our home .   she is easy to reach via phone or email and is always willing to help in any way she can .   she maintains ongoing contact with our tenants in a proactive way to insure they are satisfied with the property and to address any issues quickly .   while she has managed our home ,  we ' ve had two wonderful long-term tenants ,  and i credit dorothy ' s careful screening process and hands on approach to finding good tenants for the limited turnover .   we would highly recommend dorothy and her company private lodgings to anyone who is looking for a property management company in the cleveland area .   she ' s absolutely wonderful to work with ! 
__label__4 glad to see the stevensons name and great burgers didnt die when the old building up on lakeshore was crumbling to bits .   came in here on a friday afternoon before the after work worriors and the power lunch ,  polo shirt statues frequent and im glad i did .   the ladies behind the bar were both cool and the patrons gave a smile if ya made eye contact .   there were drink specials and they actually told you before ordering what they were and didnt try to keep it a well guarded secret !   ordered shots ,  beers and a stevenson burger .   tastes just as good as years passed .   once i found out this place used to be a seedy strip club i was automatically smitten by the neon blue lights and imaginary ,  yet faint smell of stripper lotion and regret still lingering in the air .   only thing i can say is the beer lines in this place need cleaned something aweful .   tastes like buttery cat ass in a glass .  .  . yumm .  .  . 
__label__3 did an internet search within 300 miles of rochester ,  ny ,  and found a 2014 maxima at this dealership with less than 1 , 000 miles ,   tons of options ,  and priced about $15k below original sticker .   at that price ,  the car purchase was a no brainer .   flew to cleveland and drove it back to rochester same day .   the dealer even picked me up at the airport in my car .   jeremy is great .   easy to work with and very professional .   he spent considerable time showing me how to operate all the features on the car .   considering i had a check with me and proof of insurance ,  i spent more time at the dealer than i should have had to though .   probably because they weren ' t making any money on the car ,  the finance group gave me a hard sales pitch on additional warranty ,  lo-jack ,  fabric protection ,  etc .  to the tune of about an additional $5k ,  which really turned me off .   i declined all services ,  as the car still has a factory warranty through mid 2018 ,  and an additional power-train warranty for several additional years through the certified pre-owned program .   one would think that when i already have two warranties ,  i shouldn ' t have to be sold on the concept of buying a third .   and if the first two warranties don ' t provide sufficient coverage ,  then fix the problem by bumping up the price a bit and including a more comprehensive warranty so i don ' t need to endure a whole separate song and dance about all the things those warranties  ( which were a main reason i purchased that vehicle )  don ' t cover .   and if your car is so damned reliable ,  then i shouldn ' t need three warranties to protect me from all the things that could go wrong in the first place ,  should i ?   there is one reason dealers sell warranties ,  and it ' s not to protect the customer ,  it ' s to make money .   if warranties were a good deal for the customer ,  dealers wouldn ' t be selling them .   they are profitable because you pay five grand for the warranty protection ,  and most people get significantly less service value out of it than that .    car dealers still just don ' t get that people don ' t want to be nickel and dimed every time they buy a new car .   there is no point in giving me a no haggle price if you are going to hard sell me on another $5k in warranty and protection agreements .  it ' s just as annoying as haggling on price .   it may make them additional money ,  but it is a huge turn off for me as a customer .   five stars for an absolutely great deal on the car ,  which i was unable to find anywhere else in the northeast ,  but only a three star overall rating for a less than stellar customer experience ,  largely due to the warranty pitch . 
__label__4 loved it !   i wish we had one of these near my office .   so many healthy options !   i especially loved the long list of side options  ( never too many choices !  )  and the crazy flavor combos  ( cheese and peanut butter ?  )   . 
__label__2 i ' m very tired of going in i ' m very tired of going into place is getting bad service is overpriced is everything is anymore i ' m just surprised that the service is so bad i ' ll give this place one more try but that ' s it
__label__5 this is my go to stop while i uber in lakewood .   i always ask maria to put me together a smoothie based on how i feel .   she is 5 for 5 and making some pretty dope smoothies .   good service and very knowledgeable staff is why i stay going to that liquid planet .  .  . if you ever stop ask for maria and she will put you together ! 
__label__1 this place has a really cool atmosphere ,  but the food just plain isn ' t good !   good prices but a i think a lot of the food is just bland ! 
__label__5 my favorite bakery in cleveland !    trust me ,  get a mandel splinter  ( the phallic-looking chocolate and marzipan treat )  .  and then compliment this review after !  there ' s nothing quite like it in cleveland .    also try the italian sub !  there ' s something extra special about their made-to-order ,  sliced cold cuts on fresh bread !  it ' s simple and a great cheap lunch .   check the day old / discounted section in the corner first ,  better grab that poppy-seed roll before i do . 
__label__4 my german great-grandmother ,  and grandmother ,  and mother all made apple kuchen during the halcyon days of my youth ,  each placing it to cool just out of my reach ,  which could explain so much ,  but let ' s leave that to my phalanx of psychiatric professionals .   so when i staggered into michael ' s and saw fresh ,  warm kuchen ,  right there in the front case ,  i was a goner .   i asked if they just had a barcalounger in the back ,  maybe a quilt ,  some pajamas .  .  .  i was planning on staying a good long time .   but i had to scram back to work ,  so i ordered the kaiser sandwich .   since there is no such animal as a "ham , " i had ham and swiss ,  on a fresh-on-the-inside-crunchy-on-the-outside sesame roll .   one of my grandmas working there sliced the bread ,  then grabbed a honey ham and sliced that ,  then grabbed the cheese and sliced that .   yeah ,  fresh ,  home-made ,  with that hair-in-a-bun-rocking-the-apron old world style service .   neat ,  efficient ,  and all for seiben deutsche marks ,  ja ,  as i just had to grab a white chocolate with hazelnut bar .   had to .   i ' m thankful for the half of my blood that ' s german ,  biergartens ,  all those german cars i drove too fast in that aforementioned youth ,  marlene dietrich ,  arthur shopenhauer ,  bavarian cream pie ,  rainer maria rilke ,  the westhof knife ,  wim wenders ,  weissenborn guitars ,  christian frederick martin ,  "ze lingonberry pancakes , " the porsche 550 spyder ,  and that elusive blonde from the co-ed dorm my freshman year .   let ' s call her ilsa ,  since it couldn ' t possibly be ilsa .  that one haunts me .   "well i ' ve lost my equilibrium and my car keys and my pride ,  the tattoo parlor ' s warm ,  and so i hustle there inside; and the grinding of the buzz-saw ,  "what you want that thing to say ? " i says ,  "don ' t misspell her name ,  buddy ,  she ' s the one that got away . "  tom waits
__label__4 went here after the ale fest .   i really needed food and was getting that nasty feeling of drinking too much thick beer on a very warm day .  not even really buzzed just rot gut and very hungry !   i may actually be aging .   went here with some very good friends .  man ,  i love tremont !   we ordered a bunch of apps and i got a lamb burger .     the feta cheese and olive app was amazing .   the portion was ridiculous . it was very tasty and very mild .  not too much salt .  it tasted like it was made in house !  i would be fine with this as an entree .  only way it could be improved apon would be to pour some high end olive oil on it !   perfect for my mostly low carb diet ! - 3 years down from 210 to about the upper 150 ' s .  :  )   the humus was pretty tasty as well .  the "pita bread" that came with it was amazing .  i do need to preface that with the fact is more like naan then pita .  it was served hot like it came off a grill or tandoori oven .  it was heavenly .  .  .  now i am not a fatty but the portion of humus could have been a bit bigger ,  i rather pay a bit more and be able to share more !   the next app was the haydari or yogurt type of dip  .   it was pretty tasty but does not do much for me .  i enjoy it more as a condiment .   that is the beauty of food ,  it is all subjective .   lastly and a bit sadly ,  was the lamb burger .  i know ,  don ' t go to a fcuk ' n ethnic  restaurant and order a burger .   i was craving it ,  sorry .   and it was really really average .   it was maybe 4oz on a generic bun .   it is served with some yogurt type of sauce which was tasty .   lets just say it was absolutely anticlimactic compared to what preceded .   the fries were served hot and crispy as  i had specified !  do not get the lamb burger unless you are a stupid gringo like me !   this is really a great place and i will have to go back .  the prices are very reasonable .  most app 5-7 buck ,  entrees under 20 ,  and even had good draft beers for like omg 3 . 5 a pint .    great food ,  great service ,  great ambiance ,  great value .  that is my summation for this review .  . 
__label__4 among anatolia cafe ,  aladdin ' s ( cedar / fairmount )  and this restaurant ,  istanbul grill is the best .  they use the freshest ingredients !  !  !   sitting at their patio duing lunch in the summer time with turkish beer was very pleasant .  my partner said that the lamb kabab roll was far best among other restaurants .  i really loved their complementary pita .  i recently ate at aladdin ' s but their pita was nothing like the ones from istanbul grill .    i am very picky for rice .  the rice which comes with dish at istanbul grill are very very good .  i luv it .   shepherd salad  ( chopped cucumbers ,  tomatos ,  onions with herbs .  .  .  )  was very fresh !  as a petite girl myself ,  this appetizer with pita filled me up for a lunch .   there is only mystery about this restaurant ,  which is waitress there .  we ' ve dined there several times but everytime we order ,  they ' d come back to our table to ask what the order was or even forget orders .  so we ended up eating an appetizer after the dinner .  it is crazy that they never get orders right .  hmm .   besides that ,    istanbul grill and superior pho are two restaurants  ( $10 )  which make me and my wallet happy .  i wish they had more vegetables and fish dish on the menu though .  as a veggie ,  fish lover ,  i only had 2 or 3 dishes to order from the menu including an appetizer salad . 
__label__5 this place is the best at what it does .   super cheap ,  super simple food .   i stop in a lot early on saturday mornings and get eggs .   the ladies behind the counter are gruff but actually super sweet and nice ,  you just need to roll with them . 
__label__4 probably the only bright point in the steelyard .  this is the land of organic and non-gmo .  unlike most aldi ,  this one is not cramped .  always spotless ,  including the lot .    as others have pointed out ,  bring your quarter for the cart ,  and your reusable bags .   aldi is indeed cheap for most things .  they are on par with save a lot in that regard .  aldi ,  being aldi ,  carries organic apple cider vinegar ,  but zero white vinegar .  they have begun carrying some national brands ,  like coca cola .    employees are always great and friendly . 
__label__4 this place is wonderful .  the food prices are low ,  so you ' d expect bad service or maybe a disorganized store but this is not the case at this location .  the shelves have been fully stocked and well organized every time i ' ve been there .  the workers are nice and they work hard .  so the reason for my 4 star review ,  is the checkout .  it actually is the best and worst part .  the checkout is super speedy- i ' ve had a cartload of food checked out in under five minutes but this is because they don ' t bag anything for you .  so great in terms of efficiency ,  but it sucks to have to bag all of your stuff .  furthermore ,  you need to bring your own bags or get charged for pastic /  paper bags .  now i know this is how they keep costs down ,  don ' t have baggers so that they don ' t have to pay as many employees and have less expenses on buying bags ,  but someone reading this review should know what they are in for before going to aldis .    to sum ,  i highly recommend this store !  well maintained ,  great prices ,  and workers are quick and helpful .  only downsides are the lack of bags and baggers to bag your groceries  ( haha )  ,  which actually makes you bring your own bags .  which means you are saving the environment .  which is cool .    last thing: debit card ,  cash /  check accepted .  no credit cards . 
__label__3 service was good ,  hostess was friendly; yet i was disappointed .  my girlfriend and i went on tuesday ,  i was hoping for great bbq ,  but with such small portions and weak sauce ,  i will not return .  we love southern bbq ,  not cleveland bbq !  ! b
__label__5 amazing bbq .  mr symon has done a superb job .  best brisket i ' ve ever had - get the fatty .  the kielbasa was spicy ,  smoky ,  juicy ,  and delicious .  ribs were also pretty tasty .    must get these: pigs ears  ( uuuuuuuuh )  potatoes  ( real tasty )  fatty brisket kielbasa
__label__4 great place !   the pork belly was our favorite and pork ribs a close second .   cracklins were amazing ! 
__label__5 amazing brunch place !  we tried their famous benedicts and they we so delicious !  the atmosphere is very nice and the quality of ingredients make a huge difference .  great food ,  great service - definitely recommend it ! 
__label__3 having lived in the south ,  i have a skewed opinion of this place and the food offerings .  it ' s ok at best  ,  perhaps for cleveland standards it might be good as i read through the other reviews but when you compare it to the real bbq from tennessee or texas this place doesn ' t even compare or come close .  a for effort ,  b for food quality and a c for service delivery  ,  perhaps with more menu knowledge and time ,  service delivery will improve to match the hipster county vibe the place is trying to give off .  my recommendation  ,  try it for yourself to determine  ! 
__label__2 45 minute wait to get seated .    the brisket was good but i expected it to be better ,  in fact the casino buffet 2 blocks down has a comparable brisket .    the pork ribs with the dry rub had a decent flavor but were severely under-cooked .  michael symon has been quoted as saying "ribs should have some chew to them" ,  i don ' t think he meant not being able to get the meat away from the bone .  ribs 101 is the bones poking through the top is the indication of them being cooked .   if you refer to my picture you will not see a bone in site .  i would think a guy that hosts a show on barbecue would know how to cook a decent rib .    the cracklins just tasted like butter for some reason .  there was no salt or seasoning on them that i could tell  there are better options around town so your better off skipping mable ' s .  oh and a disappointing meal for 2 cost a little over $70 .    cleveland ' s second favorite son disappoints with its one . 
__label__3 i ' m used to a friend of the family cutting my hair ,  and i never walk into her studio with any plan aside from wanting a different  ' do .   i shouldn ' t have taken this approach anywhere else ,  and i realize this now .   but i walked into cm looking for a shorter cut ,  in preparation for flying to japan to see my boyfriend .  i specified i was looking for something "hot" .  i walked out looking like suri cruise ,  which .  .  . isn ' t hot .  i was not so pleased .    that said ,  it was my fault for not having more in mind of what i wanted .  if i go back ,  it will be with a picture or two in hand . 
__label__5 i had booked an appt for my whole family and i have to say ,  they were amazing and very helpful !  my boyfriend and son haircuts took less than 20 mins and their new hairstyles were so cool !  i was so lucky to get cameron ,  he did a wonderful job and i will be bringing my family back again !  thank you so much for an awesome experience . 
__label__4 solid haircuts in a unpretentious atmosphere .    melissa is the bomb dot com .   the rest of the staff is super friendly  sometimes ,  though .   i miss the frills of a real salon .   it wouldn ' t hurt them to have a few beverages to offer regulars . 
__label__5 i ' m a big fan of crazy mullets .  i love that i can walk into this place and not feel like a scumbag because i ' m not carrying a gucci bag and / or wearing true religion ' s .    i used to frequent the lakewood location but have since moved back to the good old east side and this location is obviously closer to me .  it ' s pretty much the same ,  except not because there are different stylists .    erin cut my hair and i pretty much love it .  she was the cutest ,  most friendly little thing and i had a good time with her .  i wanted to steal her haircut but that just wouldn ' t have been right .    the best part about cm is that you don ' t pay an arm and a leg for a haircut .  it ' s never more than $30 for a cut and trust me ,  you ' ll love what you get for that price .    another great thing about cm ?  the stylists are real and don ' t make annoying small talk and ask about your job ,  your kids ,  your dog ,  your grandma ,  etc . 
__label__4 in town today for sneakercon .  drop my son and buddies off and hoofed it through the below zero wind chill to this place .  why ?   because some friends told me it was awesome .  it was worth the walk .  had regular sized turkey and i was stuffed .  what a unique sandwich .   had the bread been grilled i would have given five stars .  very friendly service .  stop by and try it .   warning--come ready to eat .   you will be full when you leave
__label__5 my sister and i have visited this restaurant several times and have yet to be disappointed .  consistently great food and service to match ! 
__label__5 the father and son who own this place are great .  they did a great job patching up my bumper after i was rear-ended .  very fair pricing and a reasonable turn-around time . 
__label__4 kantina is an excellent option if you are looking for a nice place to eat .  they have a friendly staff and a good selection of food to choose from .  i ordered the falafel sandwich and potato crisps .  the falafel was well cooked but not dry although the bread on the sandwich could have been toasted a little bit .  the potato crisps looked very nice but they could have benefited from some seasoning .  overall excellent meal and for 6 . 99 it is competitive with surrounding eateries . 
__label__4 ate here for sunday brunch .  food was delicious .  they had a great selection .  had shakshuka for the first time and it was amazing .    i will say it was hard to find ,  we didn ' t really pay attention that it was a part of the hillel .  we also were expecting a restaurant type atmosphere and it appeared more like a cafeteria .  also ,  there wasn ' t a baby changing table in the bathroom ,  they did not have high chairs and no cups for kids .    it was clean and kosher which was awesome .  will definitely be coming back for brunch . 
__label__5 yeah ,  i get my haircut here too .  i mean ,  what ' s the worst they could do to me ?  yes ,  it isn ' t consistent because you always get someone different .  but that doesn ' t matter to me .  and actually ,  they ' ve always done at least a decent job ,  sometimes a really good job .    but the prices are always really low .  so give a good tip .  i hear allstate is a cleveland institution .  don ' t know much about that ,  but i believe it .    the signs on the place aren ' t very clear on their hours ,  not sure why .  closed sunday and monday .    so if you want a cheap haircut ,  this is the place to go . 
__label__5 breaker one nine ,  breaker one nine ,  we got a tasty three ton load of wavy gravy rumbling outside the house that rock built .  i can ' t remember if i ' ve eaten from a food truck period at this point ,  but this was definitely the first time i ' ve had touch grub .  the pooch and i were taking in some voinovich park sunshine and it happened to be a big day downtown .  noon tribe game ,  goodtime iii revelers steaming off to some certain doom ,  weirdoes walking around the court building ( that actually happens 24 / 7 )  .  we were going to get a street dog ,  but waiting till we got to the harbor and seeing three food trucks idling there was a great move .  we ordered the kobe dog .  gigantic beef sausage smothered in chili and cheese .  the dog was in disbelief that you can just give a random vehicle a card and they ' ll give you meat !  that ' s right .  they take the card .  do all trucks ?  i wouldn ' t know .  i don ' t get out much .  it was the perfect noon time treat for two weary travelers .  and voinovich park totally sucks .  what ' s the big deal . 
__label__5 love this truck !  touch food truck honestly has some of the best tacos !  !  they are seasoned to perfection .  they have a variety of tacos ,  shrimp ,  beef ,  chicken ,  pork ,  etc .  the price is perfect !  !  love this truck ! 
__label__4 my ideal bookstore would be the kind where i feel utterly ,  gloriously lost - with endless shelves of books reaching back as far as the eye can see ,  and when i trail my fingers along the wooden shelves of the science fiction / fantasy section ,  i find so many authors that lordy ,  i don ' t know what to pick .     i want total brainfreeze when i walk into a bookstore - presented with so many choices that it takes me an hour to wiggle my way to a purchase ,  regretfully leaving a pile of books i want to read behind ,  muscling my way to the counter only thanks to the strength of a thoroughly-sugared cup of coffee and a cookie .   books a million is not that store ,  sadly .   but it ain ' t bad ,  either .     it is very ,  very large .   that ' s in its favor .   sadly ,  the selection despite all the books isn ' t quite as good as i ' d like it to be - perhaps it ' s a problem common to all new stores ,  but the books seem to focus on the new ,  ignoring the classics .   if it ' s not been published in the past year and it ' s not an absolute slam-dunk classics ,  your chances of stumbling across omg ,  i ' ve been looking for that book forever are slim .   the staff is not the most educated in bookery ,  not yet - they ' ve seemed perplexed by my request every time i ' ve asked them for a book ,  never having heard of a single one of my choices - but they have cheerfully and efficiently looked them up ,  and offered to order them .     the selection of recent books ,  however ,  is great ,  and i love having a gigantic frickin '  mall of a store across the street from me .   i love them so much that i walk over every three weeks and buy a book even if i don ' t need it ,  because i want to keep these folks in business and the book economy is hard these days .     in short ,  good for new books .   okay ,  if not squeeful ,  for browsing .   you could do worse ,  and chances are good you ' ll emerge with some books in your hand if you ' re not a sinful ,  ugly luddite who hates reading .   get to . 
__label__2 i went there for lunch and i had a few tamales to go ,  the flavor was lacking ,  as well as the texture .   it felt like eating marzipan ,  and there was very little tiny pieces of protein .   for almost 3 dollars a piece ,  its not worth it .   i may go back to try other items . 
__label__3 limited menu  kinda junky  a tad pricey  i ' ve had better guacamole  i ' ve had better margaritas   not a top cleveland mexican contender
__label__4 excellent salsas .  food was flavorful and fresh .  good service .  we stopped by after one afternoon after visiting the west side market at sat on the patio on the front on west 25th .  the atmosphere was interested with good people-watching but there were some aggressive crazy / homeless people lurking in the immediate vicinity of the patio .  the price was a little high for what it is but overall a good experience .  i would come back if i was in the area and looking for mexican done right . 
__label__1 i have never used yelp before ,  but i signed up after my horrible experience here .  first ,  my boyfriend and i went on a saturday night .  we made a reservation for 8:30 since a saturday night in ohio city usually means everything will be packed .  when we walked in ,  there were only two occupied tables .  that should have been the first indication to leave ,  yet i was determined to try this place out after reading previous yelp reviews .  we had three samples of salsa ,  which were all fairly good and flavorful; however that ' s where our positive experience ended .  we each got margaritas that were far too sweet and incredibly overpriced .  my boyfriend got a cup of the tortilla soup ,  however it had absolutely no flavor !  i normally don ' t care for anything terribly spicy ,  but even i found it to be incredibly bland .  next ,  he had the steak tacos ,  yet stated there was no flavor in those either and they were almost too messy to handle .  i got the three enchiladas ,  which i was told was a new dish and people seemed to like it .  this dish was horrible .  there was far too much lime flavoring ,  making it almost completely inedible ,  not to mention the chicken inside was completely dried out and flavorless as if it had been sitting around for a very long time and was just nuked in the microwave .  i barely made it halfway through my dish before i was too disgusted to eat any more .  to add insult to injury ,  this dreadful meal cost roughly $60 !  i ' d rather go to barrio or even cozumel than ever come here again .  they should truly be ashamed of themselves between the horrible quality of the food and the outrageous prices for meals that are clearly just warmed up in a microwave  ( we could hear the microwave running in the kitchen from where we were seated )  .  don ' t even get me started on the uncomfortable atmosphere !  the tables are far too small for even two people and it ' s so quiet ,  we were nervous to talk above even a whisper !   i could get the same bad service at a mcdonald ' s for only a few bucks ,  that is how terrible this place was . 
__label__5 i really liked this place .  the staff was very friendly and the food was not your typical mexican fare .  the food is very authentic .  i wanted some guacamole and asked if they had some on the menu and was told that they didn ' t  .  a few minutes later the chef personally made and brought us out some guacamole  ,  who does that ?  i would definitely recommend this place to anyone .  and the guacamole was awesome  !  !  ! 
__label__5 definitely make the trip to this wonderful establishment !  the food is phenomenal and the staff is courteous .  their tortilla chips are made in-house and different salsa ' s will leave you wondering where this place was hiding in the stars of the gods !  highly recommended !  !  !  !  ! 
__label__4 i ' m relocating out of state and have some stuff that i couldn ' t donate or didn ' t want to leave on the side walk for trash day .  i googled and found 1-800-got-junk .   the webpage appeared a little out of the box cheesy ,  but you could schedule online in great detail ,  picking days and hours - i chose to have my stuff picked up the next day .   simply put - they do what they say they will .  the pickup was to be between 1 and 3pm .   the guys actually called early and did their stuff .  nice folks too .  this is how businesses should work . 
__label__4 we tried to get into another restaurant at 945 and we ' re told we couldn ' t come in because they were closing in 15 minutes .   we came here and they opened their arms .   they must be really good because they are sold out of their ribs for the night .   we ordered the brisket ,  turkey ,  kiabalsa ,  and pork belly .   the waiter was happy to help us decide what was best and didn ' t push any particular item ,  but rather answered our questions and guided us as needed .   the atmosphere is lively and family friendly .   they have the ufc match on so bonus points for that !   this is going to be the second restaurant that is redeeming cleveland this weekend .   every food option we got was terrific .   the mabel ' s bbq sauce is a mustard based and was awesome .   the  secret aardvark habanero hot sauce was delicious  .  .  .  at least for me .   i think i ' m the only one who tried it .   if i had to get just one or two options from what we tried ,  i would go with the brisket and kiabalsa .    there is a full bar .   actually ,  3 / 4 of the menu is awesome drinks ,  mixed and almost whatever you want .   too bad i ' m the driver . 
__label__3 good food ,  friendly bartenders ,  nice fun environment .  just nothing spectacular for this ribs fan .  rendezvous in memphis has no threat here . 
__label__4 delicious large servings of meat paired with delicious beer and a large robust menu .  i have been here only once but i reminisce of the taste of the meat .  it ' s very ,  very delicious .  it has a dark steakhouse-like atmosphere and a rustic feel to it .  great for large parties and full of food to share .  the staff seemed friendly .  prices aren ' t cheap ,  but this isn ' t cheap meat .  it ' s delicious . 
__label__4 tasty bbq ,  good drinks .  be sure to save room for the outstanding desserts ! 
__label__5 we took our family here for lunch and had a great experience .  delicious food and fast service .  i had the brisket sandwich and my husband had the brisket plate .   both were excellent .  i wasn ' t a fan of the bloody mary ,  too small for the price and ok taste .  they did have a great beer selection though .  will definitely come back . 
__label__3 i really really wanted to love this place .  i was thrilled when i heard a bbq joint was coming to downtown cleveland and with a big name backing it up you would think it would be exquisite food ,  wrong !  you walk in the smell has your mouth watering with excitement !  i got the mr .  beef sandwich which is plenty to serve two if you get a side .  the meat itself was great ,  not dry but what really really disappointed me was the substantial lack of sauce .  when you think bbq you immediately think sauce .  the only option is this disgusting vinegar mustard base sauce that ruined my sandwich .  i ' m glad i put it on the side .  luckily my leftovers tasted great with a bottle of some sweet baby ray ' s to save the day !  if i come back i ' ll be bringing my own sauce ! 
__label__5 had the "this is cleveland" .   it was superb .   great selection of beer too .   zachary the barman was the best . 
__label__5 bbq done right .  rubbed and smoked .  the lamb ribs were amazing . 
__label__3 not the best bruegger ' s ,  but it is in an airport ,  so what do you expect ?  it has been hit or miss for me .    ps: i always order the siracha egg sandwich on a rosemary bagel .  the rosemary bagels are the reason i go to bruegger ' s at all ,  and in my opinion they are significantly better than any other bagel there . 
__label__5 they are some of the most professional and kind people in the business .  they will go out of their way to care about every detail of your event ,  and do whatever they can to make it memorable .  their quality is unsurpassed and their service top notch .  they provide some of the best entertainment in the city at a reasonable cost .  c . m . g .  is one of the best at everything they do . 
__label__1 decided to try this out vs the other local chinese places .  i was weary of the bad reviews but the newest ones were pretty good so i thought i would give it a shot .  my mistake !  i ordered the sweet-and-sour chicken combination plate .  the sweet-and-sour sauce was more like water ,  the "pork" fried rice had no pork in it whatsoever .  the fried dumplings looks like they were boiled .  the eggroll was soggy .  everything was tasteless .  don ' t waste your money ! 
__label__4 i heard someone say once ,  "ask for the moon and hope for cleveland" .   i ' m not sure where that phrase came from but i thought the cleveland airport was nice and that it had all the conveniences i needed including hudson news !     come here to get your snacks ,  celebrity gossip magazines ,  gum and don ' t forget your water ! 
__label__2 this location has gotten worse over the years .   it is difficult to find help at times ,  and difficult to find what you really need .   prices are a bit steep as well .   there aren ' t many choices in the area ,  so this is where most people go . 
__label__5 so good .  best barbecue i ' ve had in cleveland so far .    this place is very busy .  i first tried to get in at 9:30 on a saturday night  ( i thought it would be less busy by then )  ,  but was told that there were 40 people ahead of me on the wait list .  i ended up going somewhere else ,  though the wait would have surprisingly only been about half an hour .  i tried going back with a group of friends on a thursday at 8:30 pm and it was much less crowded .  we got a table right away .   we ordered a little bit of everything .  all i have to say is that the meat was flavorful and very tender .  the sides are interesting - i liked the broccoli and beet salads .  the desserts are puddings served in a cup that can be shared  ( they are quite rich !  )  .  the beer selection is great .  some of my friends ordered the $35 aged cocktail ,  which was a little strong in my opinion ,  though they really liked it .   overall ,  it was a really good restaurant that i would go to again  ( if i can get a table !  ) 
__label__5 why 5 stars ?  because this might be my favorite eatery in all of downtown cleveland .      ---   ---   ---  granted ,  i have only eaten at a handful of restaurants in downtown cleveland ,  but i have a hard time imagining mabel ' s being topped .    when the question was fatty brisket vs lean brisket ,  i couldn ' t help but wonder if anyone in the history of the universe answered lean .  they say nothing tastes as good as skinny feels ,  but "they" are also dirty liars .  you go fatty brisket 100 times out of 100 and you don ' t even consider an alternative .    i also couldn ' t resist ordering spaetzle as my side dish ,  because of my affinity for german cuisine .  it was really solid ,  and something i wish was found on more bbq menus around the country .    the building itself is really cool -ia0it feels like you ' re in the basement of a mansion .  we came by after an indians game ,  and it was really the perfect option ,  post-game .  why pay a premium for lower quality stadium food ,  when mabel ' s is sitting right there ,  at your pre or post game disposal .  granted ,  i ' m sure it ' s crowded before a game ,  but after a game with a huge crowd ,  we were able to be seated after a wait of only a couple minutes .   i ' ll definitely be back on my next visit to cleveland ! 
__label__5 always on point ,  always delicious .  believe the hype ,  bc it ' s real .  s / o to the friendly staff as well ! 
__label__5 great place .   had the brisket and really liked it .   enjoyed sitting outside people watching . 
__label__5 tried the brisket ,  slaw and cracklin ' s .   this was the best brisket i ' ve had and i ' ll definitely be back to try more of the menu !   for people complaining about parking ,  there are lots 2-3 blocks away for $5 .  you just have to know where to look and not just park in the closest garages right next to the q . 
__label__4 tried for the first time in the middle of june .  food was delicious and i will definitely be back to try more !  had a mr .  beef sandwich and tried the sides ordered by others at the table .  everything came out hot ,  fresh ,  and delicious !  the sauce on the beef was flavorful and the bread was fresh .  potatoes were crunchy .  the waitress was so nice and she came back to check on our table and refill our drinks just the right amount .  it was very busy and she forgot to bring my drink out with everyone else ' s ,  she brought it over and apologized profusely before i even noticed it was missing !  everything she recommended was super .  my friends had the lamb ribs and put in for a second order because they were so good !  if you enjoy bbq ,  definitely give this place a try . 
__label__3 i went back to try the beef rib .   really excellent and basically tastes just like the brisket only you get twice the amount of meat .   no need for a knife--the meat just falls off the bone .   i took the bone home for my lab but that means i ' ll have to take on the plane .   should be an interesting time at the pre-check lane .  .  . 
__label__4 pretty solid experience for me but a few friends i went with weren ' t completely satisfied .   decor was simple and industrial looking .  and seating is super limited .  we waited an hour on a sunday late afternoon for a table for four .  service was good and the server had an impressive knowledge of all the items we asked about .    i started with a potent high octane coke .  delicious .  we had the cleveland special among my bf and i .  we split the spicy kielbasa and ribs which were served with spicy sauerkraut on top .  it was a generous amount for two people .  sides are priced separately and i highly recommend the potatoes .  there ' s a mabel ' s mustard-based bbq sauce at each table which has a little bit of heat ,  but take that with a grain of salt from a person with low tolerance for spiciness .    my friends were not in love with the smoked pork belly ,  which they said was too dry .  but they seemed to love everything else : ) 
__label__4 where to start ?   the best and most delicious cupcakes i have ever tried ,  in any city .   the staff are always nice .   except the fact that i did try to go into the south euclid store a few weeks ago--the door was *open* and some girl was in there chatting with the cashier and he said "sorry ,  we ' re closed"  ( there were still plenty of cupcakes in the case )  .   so .  .  . he ' s socializing with the door open but they ' re closed ?   also ,  i hadn ' t been to this place since i moved back almost 6 mos ago ,  so i *really* wanted a cupcake lol .   i would ' ve bought 4 on the spot !   oh well ,  they lost out on their money .   other than that ,  i ' ll definitely be back and like this company .   ps- someone mentioned a $10 min and i was told that as well  ( for credit cards )  .   they are a small business and charge enough for their goods that they can afford the credit card fees .   and if they don ' t ,  then they should up their prices .   requiring a certain amount to purchase is classist .   it ' s also actually illegal and companies are not allowed to do that .   i ' ll be contacting the bbb to report . 
__label__4 great cupcakes .  ice cream is delicious ,  many many flavors !  comfortable seating ,  plated seating .  great parking .  friendly staff ! 
__label__3 grade scale 1-5 all around 3 taste 3 presentation 2 good tasting .  a little to sweet .  just the right amount of frosting .  fun presentation but kind of sloppy .   the cupcake reviewer inc
__label__4 one of the things i always make sure i do when i come home to cleveland is stop somewhere and get a polish boy .  .  i normally stop in kim ' s because it close to my mothers house and i know i won ' t be disappointed .  the polish boys here are just what i need for that taste of cleveland while i ' m here !  they have the perfect amount of sauce and fries .  the only reason i deducted a star is because this time i got wings and while i may not be the best judge since i don ' t really eat a lot of fried chicken ,  the wings weren ' t anything special .  .  i actually got two and couldn ' t even finish them both .  .    as far as decor it ' s not much to it .  .  it ' s enough wait space for you to wait while your takeout is ordered and you order over a mic through a plexiglass window . 
__label__4 its ok not one of my favorite bbq places i ' m the type of person who love a lot of sauce on my bbq food and i don ' t get it there .  .  .  .  .  . ill choose b&m ' s and open pitt over them any day
__label__3 a lot of people love kim ' s wings .  i think they are just alright .  i prefer regular buffalo wings without breading if i am going to eat chicken wings with hot sauce .  something also bothers me about the little wing .  not the beautiful song by jimi hendrix ,  the actual little wing part they leave on . 
__label__2 i ' m almost always disappointed when i go to this location .  they always seem to forget to include everything that i order and pay for ,  then when i let them know that something is missing ,  they get an attitude with me and i have to wait an extra 10 minutes .  will try them again in another few months to see if things have gotten better . 
__label__5 the shop is super-small and only two-thirds of it is filled with clothes ,  but i always find something i want .   they have some of the best vintage prices and seem to always be rotating stock so ,  you don ' t see the same things sitting there for a long time .   for its size ,  they boast a decent selection of men ' s shirts and t-shirts as well .   they also know how to pick unique things and are knowledgable about the era their pieces come from .   i always make sure to stop by when at the beachland . 
__label__4 this is my favorite carry out chinese place in town .  they do a couple things better than the other places around .  i love their eggrolls .  they ' re not out-of-your-mind amazing but they ' re consistently great and delicious .  i love their chicken entrees as well  ( sesame ,  general tao ' s )  .  the black bean chicken is always great .  their dinner combo makes for an easy meal with leftovers that ' s worth the price . 
__label__5 brett !  !  !  !  !   it ' s your favorite person ever - kimmy !  !  !   what time are you opening for the tribe ' s home opener ?  !  ?  ! 
__label__5 really surprised at this find .  the wings were fantastic ,  and the atmosphere is really nice .  drinks were well crafted and poured with a heavy hand .  my wife got a quesadilla which was really good and our friend got nachos which also didn ' t disappoint .  the beer selection is really ggod as well .  service was awesome !  will definitely come back here and grab some wings ! 
__label__5 honestly this is my go-to spot for before or after cavs and indians games .  it ' s a great spot to have a few drinks ,  get some food and have a good time .  it ' s a lot cheaper than  clevelander and city tap ,  and you won ' t have to deal with an overcrowded bar !   the bartenders are the absolute best here .  neal and mike are probably the best bartenders in cleveland .  i absolutely love this place ! 
__label__3 friday was great with forecast and the dj was decent ,  so that night got a 4 .   watch out ,  the aroma from the kitchen out back is mouth-watering .   so .  .  .  i went back on saturday .   it was a 2 .   different crowd .   friday was mostly late 30s to 50s .   saturday ,  the age veered downward .   i was so happy to hear the old school tunes but the dj ,  ellery ,  was a pain in the rear .   he only played snippets and he talked during every song !   if he wasn ' t trying to get the crowd to make noise ,  he was calling people out ,  hawking his step-mix cds ,  or talking about how wonderful he was .   he made what could have been another great night annoying and excruciating .   i won ' t be going back on saturdays . 
__label__1 i have never been so aggravated !  !  i ordered for delivery ,  gave clear address and instructions ,  over an hour later the driver was literally a block away and called because she couldn ' t find the location .  i desperately tried to talk her to the location ,  she gave up and canceled my order ,  i called the manager ,  also gave him detailed directions from the map .  .  . nope .  .  . they just canceled my order .  unbelievable !  !  i don ' t even live in cleveland ,  they do and they don ' t know how to get someplace ?  ?  !  !  !  ahhhhhhhh do not order from this place ! 
__label__5 this is my kind of place ,  no hassle parking ,  great quality food at a really reasonable price and a nice amount of food for your money .  you will leave here with your palette satisfied ,  your belly full and your wallet in tack .  i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for quality and affordable italian food .  love this place and it ' s food . 
__label__1 if there was a negative star i would use it .  went to a wedding catered by them .  what they shared with the family at the tasting was delicious .  what they served was food purchased from gfs .  it was awful .  the chicken cordon blu was perfect little rectangles obviously processed .  dry bread and a crummy salad to top things off .  their restaurant food is good but when they catered this wedding they turned the tables on all of us .  the definition of bait and switch .  the owner is less than pleasant to deal with and no apologies offered .  terrible .  buyer beware . 
__label__1 we had a gift certificate that was not honored .   which is fine ,  if you give a good reason .   instead ,  the "manager / owner" would rather say "maybe they should get there head out of there asses and print the certificate" .   maybe ,  you should get your head out of your ass and read the reviews and change a few things !  the booth we sat in was held together with duct tape !  !  someone please call restaurant impossible for them !  !  ! 
__label__4 yum !  !  !  it was a busy friday night before a cavs game and i brought several friends who were unfamiliar with cleveland .  the food was great and they have a pretty good beer selection on tap .  i had the triple grilled cheese and i loved every bite !  the house made chips are great too !  my friend ordered a cheese pizza and she gave it a hearty approval ,  which is big because she orders cheese pizza basically everywhere and not just anyone makes the cut .  although they were understaffed for the large groups that came in  ( 3 people working the bar and the grille was definitely tight )  ,  the food was great and it came out in a reasonable amount of time .  thanks again for a great meal ,  paninis !  !  ! 
__label__5 panini ' s is my go to location before and sometimes after any cleveland sporting event .  the restaurant / bar is a decent size as well as the outdoor patio .  panini ' s can get very crowded so keep that in mind .  the beers are pretty cheap and there are always shot specials .  the food is typical bar food but tasty . 
__label__5 surprised there was two panini ' s within a few miles of each other but i would commend that it was done so strategically .  one for the drunken west 6 party people and another  ( this one )  in close proximity to the baseball and basketball games .  love this place because even if you don ' t get a ticket to the game ,  you still enjoy the tribe vibe .  large pizza is only 12 bucks and is one of my favorite cle pizza places .  thin crust ,  good sauce and great price .  as was the beer .  there is indoor and outdoor patio .  staff was attentive and fun .  no close parking that was free but that would not stop me .  i heart you paninins . 
__label__5 panini ' s definitely outdoes "primanti bros" .   i ' ve tried them both .  .  .  . panani ' s for the win .   great ingredients ,  great taste ,  filling ,  and a classic in cleveland .   must try panini ' s now . 
__label__5 2nd order was better then the first !  delivery time was accurate ,  food was hot ,  driver was pleasant and friendly !  small problem with bottom of pizza being a little moist last time gone !  i am a customer ! 
__label__4 i ate an early dinner at cafi roma last week  ( week of 7-4-16 )  and it was very ,  very good .  .   i ordered an appetizer as my meal  ( sausage and peppers and onions served w / a small bowl of their sauce and hot bread and butter .  )   it was delicious .   friends ordered gnocci w / sauce .   yum .   i tasted the gnocci--home made from what i could discern .   again ,  yum .  this is not a chain .   yay .  it is not noisy .  yay .  there is no tv or music blaring away .  yay .   our server was very accommodating .    nice ,  homey and very comfy feel to this place ,  no rushing or hustling .      my appetizer ,  which was enough for my evening meal ,  was $12 ,  including the sauce and bread and butter served with it .   i believe the gnocci was $12 . 95--huge portions .   neither person could finish so they go to take leftovers home for an entire second meal .    next time i come here i ' m trying their pizza ,  which ,  if it ' s as good as their sauce ,  should be fantastic .  parking  ( free ,  of course )  is behind the restaurant . 
__label__4 big fan of the place .  i hate the location ,  they deserve better .   steves should really start to consider moving to a more "scenic" location .   the people who work there are great ,  but it ' s sad that they have to deal with riff raff and the beggers every night .   people will still come to steves hotdogs after getting wasted if they were in the heart of ohio city or even gordon square .  trust me .  move . 
__label__5 there ' s alot of things i wouldn ' t buy used .  undergarments ,  prophylactic ,  and needles to name a few .  but i will never ,  ever ,  buy a new tire again .   the savings are unbelievable .  these so called  ' used '  tires are barely used and are so inexpensive .  i don ' t know why everyone doesn ' t buy used tires .  but i ' m glad they don ' t - more used tires for the rest of us !  i got two practically new tires that still have most of their tread for $60 saving hundreds of dollars !   not all of their selection is as new and some sell for as low as $15 .  this location was a bit busy when i visited and it operates like a drive thru .  you just wait in your car until it ' s your turn .  located in a retired fire station ,  they probably have close to a thousand tires standing by to satisfy your vehicles needs .  maybe more . 
__label__5 brought in my 2011 accord to get 4 used tires .  got a great price .  they stand behind their warranty .  i came back later the same day with a leak in one of the tires and they replaced it no questions asked .  got tires with almost full tread for less than half the cost of new ones installed .  installation also had a full crew and nice looking machinery .  diamond in the rough location ,  great management as well . 
__label__5 i went here today ,  and i was blown away by this amazing little shop on broadview road .  i just moved to nearby parma less than a year ago ,  i can honestly say i am kicking myself for not finding this place earlier .  the owner and his wife were there and unbelievably nice - i bought 3 adorable vintage dresses and probably could have bought a lot more if it wasn ' t so close to closing time .  i can ' t wait to come back and spend more time ,  if you ' re in the area - i 100% recommend stopping by ! 
__label__4 there is a lot to be said for a family-run business that has stood the test of time ,  and competed against major national chains .   when i wanted to upgrade my kitchen appliances we headed straight to snow .  they offer a range of low ,  mid and high-end appliances .   i went with all jenn-air appliances and i worked with jeff to put everything together .   he provided me the contact information of who to call for a free estimate on installation and measurement to make sure everything fits in its respective places .   really nice store ,  especially the concept kitchens in the back .   i think i left a small drool pool on the floor of the miele and theramdor kitchens .   store gets very busy on saturday so i recommend going during the week . 
__label__1 awful .  drove 3 hours to look at a truck that had not been cleaned since trade in aside from the burn holes they attempted to cover up .  frank was by far the worst car salesman i ' ve dealt with .  no hello ,  no thanks for coming ,  no interest in the customer at all .  i will never visit this dealer again and would not recommend it to anyone .  if you do have to go ,  please steer clear of frank .  what a disappointment . 
__label__1 we came here to have some great food ,  drinks ,  and socialize before a cavs game .  there ' s a man outside the entrance that takes our fl ids ,  takes one judgmental look at us and says "there ' s no way i ' m letting you guys in if you ' re from out of town . " were in our 30s ,  but he said he "didn ' t want to deal with out of state ids" and told us to walk away and get out .  what a great way to turn away business and treat people who don ' t have an ohio license .  if you want to hang out at a place where people are complete jerks to you ,  this is the place to go ! 
__label__3 while sitting on the thirsty parrot deck i always wondered what wilbert ' s deal was .    it seemed like a dive bar ,  full of bad ass ,  uneducated ,  we ' re better then you ,  tools that were just there to mock the overcrowded ,  yuppie crowd paying $$$ for beers on the deck of the parrot .   boy was i wrong .   i finally decided to hit wilbert ' s before a ball game to see if the $2 bottle beer deal was for real .   an hour and a half and 8-10 beers later i realized that i am enjoying myself ,  a lot .     the place is pretty big and gets a nice crowd for all home games but not to a point where its annoying .   they also run food specials ,  i opted with the nacho and the darn thing was the size of my head .   the next time i went there we all got sandwiches and let me tell you ,  not bad ,  not bad at all .   service was slow as expected on game day but we got there early enough and anticipated a packed house .     from now on i split my time between wilbert ' s and the thirsty parrot ,  usually depending on how nice it is outside because the deck at the parrot is fantabulous .   i hear they do live music on non-ballgame days but my weekend options are usually too open to include wilbert ' s just for music .     so if you were like me sitting on the parrot patio ,  brave it and go to wilbert ' s .   table is your best bet but if there ' s room at the furthest end of the bar by the bathrooms ,  that would be best servicewise .   enjoy . 
__label__1 i ' ve been a resident for a bout 6 months ,  and i must say ,  it ' s been a great experience for the most part .  however ,  dealing with the property managers / condo association has been a complete fuckfest .  there have been several occasions where they ' ve been unresponsive ,  unreliable ,  rude ,  and completely unhelpful .  i would say the worst person that ' s a part of it is alexis wellman - she will definitely test your patience and your ability to prevent yourself from punching her in the face .   first problem: garage project - this two them about 2 . 5 weeks ,  to solely seal the garage  ( for what ?  who knows )  .  i don ' t mind parking outside ,  except when there isn ' t enough spaces for residents to park ,  which forces me to park my car in an unsecured lot where it can get broken into .  which it did .  it cost me $1000 total to get my window replaced ,  all of which the condo association didn ' t show any type of remorse .    second problem: maintenance issues - it took two phone calls and an email to finally get in touch with the property managers in the building .  when i finally got in touch with them "that ' s not the condo association ' s responsibility - please contact your landlord" .  that ' s literally all they told me - if it takes you one sentence to respond ,  then why didn ' t you do it in the first place ?   again ,  neighbors are great ,  as well as the concierge - but the property managers have got to go . 
__label__4 one of my favorite musicians is mark kozelek .  his new album recorded under the moniker sun kil moon titled "benji" has been on my mind lately .  many of the songs deal with death .  the theme of this lp is the same as the current exhibit at moca .  it is entitled dirge: reflections on [life and] death .  some of the pieces made me genuinely sad and were painful to absorb .  i would almost rather listen to 2pac death around the corner because that song really jams out about death .  some of the art today made left me feeling hollow .  the artists accomplished their mission .  admission to the museum is free on the first saturday of each month .  i will likely return on each of these days when the exhibits change .  the art today was not particularly beautiful .  it was grotesque .  i am thankful to the museum for employing some cute females because that got my mind back on life .  and how beautiful it can be . 
__label__5 just wanted to share these fantastic photos from peter at cleveland photo group .   it was an amazing opportunity to have world-famous chef ferran adria in town ,  and a calendar of great events ,  and these photos capture the spirit of all the wonderful things that occurred this week . 
__label__2 the idea of moca is cool ,  but 1 )  there ' s so much room for more work 2 )  paying to park at a garage and then paying to get in feels like a bit of a rip-off for the amount of exhibits but most importantly 3 )  the docents ,  both times i ' ve been here ,  have been rude to me or i ' ve heard them be rude to other patrons .  good job . 
__label__2 i hate to say this but the museum ,  while an architectural gem and something very special for cleveland ,  is a major disappointment when it comes to actually showing ,  you know ,  art .   the first thing you see on the ground level is a gift shop ,  ticket booth and snack bar .  not a single piece of art in sight .  there ' s a giant commons area that apparently shows boring educational videos to an audience of zero .   why waste this huge space on nothing ?   i know some modern sculpture or video installations or murals that would look great here .   once you get to the exhibition spaces ,  they ' re nice and cleanly designed .  but the art on the day we went ,  the show in the biggest gallery ,  corita kent ' s beautiful political prints ,  was charming and sweet but a little middlebrow .  we were hoping to be challenged a lot more .    and what ' s with all the classrooms ,  children ' s drawing tables and empty rooms playing educational video nobody wants to see ?   why not turn some of these smaller rooms into exhibition spaces ?  why is there so much unused space ?  i don ' t understand .  the wasted space actually makes me ,  a big fan of contemporary art ,  very angry .    i don ' t understand this museum ' s priorities .   is it art or education ?  is it art or empty space ?  is it art or a gift shop ?  the answer to me ,  on my one and perhaps only visit ,  is that art ,  especially challenging new work ,  is taking a back seat . 
__label__2 interesting museum , but there is not much to it .  i am glad i went on a free day  ( the first saturday of the month )  as i would not want to pay $8 for just three exhibits .  however ,  the gift shop was probably my favorite part and i ended up walking away with some cool new wine glasses . 
__label__1 for the love of god ,  please hire people who will work efficiently or just shut this location down . 
__label__2 i love me some chipotle ,  and i like getting some whenever i ' m too busy to cook ,  need a pick me up meal ,  or am just craving it .  unfortunately ,  i ' m stuck with this location since it is located so conveniently on campus .   it doesn ' t matter how short the line is ,  i just assume a 20 minute wait  ( and that is a fast day--try to avoid peak lunch / dinner hours ,  and order online if you can )  .  somehow they manage to be so slow at serving food .  additionally ,  they seem to be really bad at keeping all the ingredients ready when they start running out .  there have been times where i was told a 5 minute wait for something ,  and it ends up taking 15 minutes ,  which is just ridiculous .   additionally ,  i don ' t know if it is because i ' m a small asian girl ,  but they always skimp on portions ,  when i see them giving so much more to the person in front of me .  not cool .  i end up asking for more ,  but a lot of the times they give the tiniest bit more and roll their eyes if i ask again .  i usually end up just asking for it on the side if i don ' t want to deal with it .   i won ' t stop coming back to this place ,  but i also won ' t stop complaining to friends about how slow this place is either . 
__label__2 this place is so inconsistent that if they had the same food ,  but had any other name they would be out of business .   the service is soooooooooo slow that i can ' t even tell you .   if you have 30 minutes for lunch .  .  . you will be eating in your car on the way back to the office .     this place is managed poorly at best .  .  . what will they be out of next .  .  . get in line and you ' ll find out in 30 minutes . 
__label__1 must say worst one i have been to .  staff too busy talking to each other ,  elbow bumping friends and letting food run out on line to take care of customers .  server scrapper bottom of meat container and i got maybe 6 pieces of chicken to eat .  friend got bottom of steak container and meat was hard .  if i could give a negative star i would . 
__label__1 without a doubt the worst one i have been to .  the avocado was frozen ,  they ran out of cheese ,  and it took 15 minutes and i was the only one on the line .  staff seems to be hanging out in the back and no manager on duty .    i also saw the cook overlooking the chicken and not caring cause he ' s cracking jokes with the girl who can ' t seem to figure out how to replace the beans .    whoever owns this should fire their manager or hire one to keep these kids in line . 
__label__5 i really enjoy practicing yoga at the atma center .   it is truly a relaxing and meditative experience .   this is not a fast paced competitive studio ,  rather the classes are led at a pace that makes you think and feel each movement .   the result is a class that leaves you feeling refreshed and recharged .   i have been practicing here for several months and taken a variety of classes .   the students here are all ages and sizes and the teachers are very welcoming and knowledgeable .     i highly recommend this studio if you are looking for a place to slow down ,  relax and get more in tune with your body . 
__label__5 an excellent studio grounded in traditional yoga ,  this is not at all like the typical classes that are called "yoga" in the us .  no  ' power '  or heated yoga ,  of which we have way more than we should ,  with it ' s body-focused ,  hot environment  ( in india ,  yoga is generally practiced in the early morning ,  the coolest part of the day .  so much for following tradition )  .  this is truly a place where all bodies and abilities can enjoy the healing and life-changing benefits of a solid yoga practice .  i ' m a yoga teacher and advanced practitioner ,  and this is where i choose to practice and further my learning .  very welcoming and they have a lot of workshops and celebrations over the course of a year ,  it ' s a great atmosphere ! 
__label__5 tried this place for the first time today .  great experience !   placed a lunch order online but arrived a few minutes early .  they hadn ' t made my bowl yet so that it was fresh upon pickup .  very thoughtful .  i had the chicken and rice bowl with coconut ginger sauce .  i ' m not a big asian food eater but this was fantastic .  i may have to get it again tomorrow ! 
__label__3 tea house noodles is a good place to grab lunch downtown .  the staff is very friendly and the line moves fast .  seating is limited and it can be difficult to find a table at the peak of lunch hour .  the customer first picks if it will be a rice or noodle dish ,  second a sauce and an optional third protein item .  they also offer daily specials for around $6 . 00 .  they have fresh squeezed juices ,  smoothies ,  salads and soups .  tea house noodles is a better option than the chinese buffet downtown . 
__label__5 i ordered through grubhub .  .  . and wow ,  i was impressed !   food was quick and tasted amazing !   i got the pad thai bowl with tofu and the flavors were perfect !   great size and prices ! 
__label__4 i think i like the atmosphere of that place better than the food .  . noodles are just noodles .  .  .  i would add a variety .  .  .  also ,  there is no way to opt for a certain kind of veggies .  .  .  they come pre mixed .  i added chicken ,  which was just a plain chicken .  . i gave it two tries and now i know it ' s just not for me .  .  but the people who work there are super awesome ! 
__label__4 teahouse noodles is a difficult place to review .  on one hand ,  they have some very tasty and healthy combinations ,  however you can quite easily stray into no-mans-land with some of the combinations available on the menu .   don ' t be afraid to ask for a recommendation on what ' s popular if you have not been here before .   if you ' re new to teahouse ,  you can ' t go wrong with one of the premade options such as the pad thai ,  freakin '  chicken or asian chicken chili over rice .   these will help introduce you to the sauces and give you an idea on how to build your own bowl to achieve a good flavor profile .   i usually ask for easy sauce on any of the dishes ,  as they can be a little overwhelming with sauces  ( though they are very good )  .  it can be on the messier side to eat ,  especially over noodles as they have a tendency to fling sauce every which way .   overall ,  teahouse is a good place for a quick ,  healthy meal and great option for vegetarians . 
__label__5 my favorite lunch spot downtown .   teahouse is tucked away at the end of short vincent where you always feel the ghosts of the cleveland mob in their heyday .   what do i love about this place ?   it ' s great ,  fresh ,  healthy and cheap .   my "standard" is the brown rice bowl ,  topped with steamed veggies an extra rica rica sauce .    the rica rica is a sweet and hot chili sauce from the pacific rim .   sometimes i top my bowl with chicken or tofu but sometimes i just buy it without the protein .   another favorite are the freakin '  rican beans .   i love rica rica so much i literally do buy it by the case for my home .   you can buy it by the bottle ,  but they have not found a distributor yet to sell it more conveniently .     the service is very fast since the menu is limited .   i highly recommend this set up in the form of a food truck since not much space is needed .   the employees are very nice and will always let you sample the sauce before you order it .     i always get a glass of their lime-aid and never anything else to drink .   their smoothies are good too ,  but i just don ' t do many smoothies .   get their early because there is limited seating .   most downtowners buy it "to-go" and if you get there after 11:45 ,  plan to wait in line outside the door .   teahouse once opened a place with seating a few blocks away in reserve square but it didn ' t make it :- (     i went there a few times because i was guaranteed a seat .     teahouse is only open for luch monday through friday .   too bad ,  but i understand .   their restaurant in little italy is open saturdays and i think for dinner .   they take credit cards; lunches run about $6 plus a beverage .   parking is limited at meters .   it ' s downtown ,  what do you expect ? 
__label__5 we r here from out of town .  the service was great .  everyone super friendly .  and the food was even better .  so many great choices on the menu .  i went with the bbq beef sandwich .  my husband had ribs and kids went with chicken fingers and bleu cheese burger .  nothing left over .  the music was great and local .  serious had a great time .  oh fries - amazing !   oh rice and beans ,  even better .  really .  go there now ! 
__label__1 when i tried to go there for dinner with friends ,  they kicked us out from the table and made us go to the corner .   the place was mostly empty ,  but they reasoned they needed the table in case a large family came in .   i had to leave .   i ' m autistic ,  so i don ' t like get treated like a second class citizen no matter what the reason .   i don ' t think i can go back ,  and i ' ll probably not be able to get some sleep tonight . 
__label__5 wilbert ' s is awesome .  i usually go here to pregame before cleveland sporting events .  on friday ' s they host live bands ,  which is pretty cool .  the drinks are super cheap and the bartenders are very sweet . 
__label__4 great place before a tribe game !  great drink prices with $2 domestic tallboys  ( $4-$5 next door )  and $3 grape / cherry bombs .  and if you ' re feeling crazy their irish car bombs are 5 bucks .  can ' t beat that for being right next to the stadium !  also ,  i hear the food is very good but have yet to try .  definitely my go-to pre-game for the indians .

__label__5 12-15 $2 drafts for crafts beer week  ( normally ,  they ' re $4 which is very reasonable for cleveland ) : stone ipa ,  3 or 4 fall beers  ( southern tier ,  paulaner oktoberfest-mie4rzen ,  thirsty dog )  ,  young ' s chocolate ,  a thirsty dog .    best cleveland beer week deal ever  !    it was my first show at wilbert ' s  ( it was free !  )  and the first band went on at 8pm as scheduled .  the bar itself closed right after the last band finished at 10:30ish .    unfortunately for the bands and the bar ,  there was about an equal amount of customers and band members and staff .  service at the bar was great . 
__label__5 i am horrible at making pasta ,  so i love ohio city pasta .  so many varieties and they are all delicious .  i love pasta so i ' m very picky about it and i ' ve never been upset with a purchase .  they are provide pasta to a lot of local restaurants like noodlecat and it ' s always delicious . 
__label__5 i hit up ocp at wsm and make the best spaghetti ever !  !  !  !  vinc ' s has great hot italian sausage and i always go to that stand .  the veggies are truly hit or miss ,  usually they look .  .  . meh .  .  . but last weekend finally some on vine tomatoes that were destined to make great sauce ,  and they did !  threw in some fresh-ish basil and guests loved the sauce ,  pasta and hot sausage !   maybe a little pricey but sure makes delish pasta !  !  !  yum ! 
__label__4 i ' m not sure if this is the right place to post this .  we buy their pasta from the west side market .  we had the mushroom and fontina ravioli and it was superb !  i don ' t eat a lot of pasta  ( growing up in an italian household ruined me haha )  but when i do ,  i buy from these guys !  you seriously won ' t regret it ! 
__label__5 i ' m totally addicted and spoiled by this pasta .   i can ' t even buy regular boxed pasta anymore !    there ' s tons of flavor options to choose from if you hit up their stand at the west side market .  you can find their pastas in certain markets ,  but selection is limited .    check them out on facebook .  they run specials often ! 
__label__5 italian food as authentic as it gets .   right down to the owner .    the pasta is awesome and the service is great !  !   huge portions .  had my son ' s wedding rehearsal dinner there and the people could not stop talking about it . 
__label__5 i was fortunate enough to be in discussion with director jill zupon during the formation of her initial concepts regarding the attention center .  i observed as she spearheaded and developed the center .  i have visited the attention center on several occasions .  the service provided by the attention center is unparallelled in the cleveland area .  ms .  zupon has obtained the advice and counsel of numerous professionals in the field ,  many of them nationally-renowned .  the bottom-line is always ,  of course ,  that the individuals treated at the center have lives that improve dramatically ,  and that includes their family members and other loved-ones .  keep up the great work ,  attention center ! 
__label__5 landlord interference  is why they shut down .   hope they will reopen in a better location
__label__5 service ,  food ,  and drinks were all great !  i highly recommend the calamari appetizer - honestly the best calamari i ' ve ever had .  it was a bit pricy ,  but the waiter did inform me that they have special deals on certain week nights
__label__4 since michael hershmann arrived we have been back a number of times and each visit has been enjoyable .  it ' s not that it was bad before ,  it was just average .  the last visit offered a wonderful salmon special .  the gouda grits side dish was so good it could almost  (  almost )  be a main dish .    this place has been in cleveland heights for years and after that time you might assume a sloppy result .  not so .  they remain very on-game . 
__label__2 overpriced and totally average .   two good things about this place are the friendly service and the outdoor seating .   came here on a saturday night without reservations around 9pm and was seated immediately in the outdoor area .  was immediately digging the ambiance and liked the swift placement of chips and salsa which were free .  the experience went down hill from here .   i ' m a big margarita fan so i order the gold margarita which is supposed to have better tequila and be less sour according to our waitress .  my wife orders the regular .  get the ritas and take a sip and my wife nails the taste perfectly "like gatorade and tequila . " except you can barely taste the tequila .  these margaritas are way too sweet .  the gold was barely tolerable the regular was an absolute joke / nightmare .  all you get is unbearable sweetness follow but a sour taste .   anyway had the iron chef guacamole .  wife liked it but i didn ' t .  imo just has way too many flavors going on .  guac is already a complex taste why add blue cheese ,  bacon and sage ?  i don ' t get it .  like tasting 10 things at once .    we shared the chicken enchiladas .  they were ok .  nothing great and overall not too flavorful .  if they were 10 bucks i would feel ok about them but for 18 . 5 they did not even come with rice and beans and i was feeling robbed .  i am coming from nyc and even we don ' t pay this for enchiladas at a nice mexican place .   between my wife and i had two margaritas ,  iron chef quac and shared the chicken enchiladas .  bill came to about $55 with tip !  !  !  no thanks . 
__label__4 good food ,  great drinks .  cozy enviorment .  great place for a date . 
__label__3 oh hey there ,  lopez ,  stepping it up !    i can ' t bring myself to upgrade to a 4 ,  though i ' m close based on happy hour alone - yes ,  the prices are great ,  but the food and drinks were amazing too !    a friend and i decided to mix things up and go to happy hour here instead of our usual haunts and we were wowed by the margaritas we got !  our server made some suggestions that we followed and they were so good !  we had the pineapple with a spicy rim and it was perfect ,  then we went for cactus with a little spice as well and it was delicious !    the food was also amazing .  the goat cheese fundido was probably all we needed .  it was cheesy and delicious and the chips and salsa were tasty as well .  we each got a brisket taco ,  too ,  and while my taco was stuffed with beef ,  it was a little dry .  i would have been happy with less beef ,  with a little more moisture or sauce or something .   i ' ll definitely be back for some margaritas and queso .  soon . 
__label__4 ok im a 30 year veteran of los angeles mexican food ,  so first off ,  this really isnt mexican .  its mexican inspired food .  but its really good food .  have the soup .  they make really great soup .  i had one of their "tacos" - this was a wolfgang puck sort of a taco definately not a east la taco .  and again  - it was really great food .  im just drawing a clear distinction between whats served here and whats mexican because if you want mexican ,  this isnt the place for you .  if you want a really nice dining experience with some very interesting and yummy foods ,  then this is your place . 
__label__4 stopped in here on a thursday night with one of my best gal pals .  we weren ' t sure if there was going to be a happy hour since we showed up after 7 and didn ' t exactly plan on heading to lopez .  we were in the area and decided to drop in .  it had been years since either of us had been there .   lucky for us ,  as soon as we sat down we were told that margaritas were half off all night .  so ,  we hunkered down for chit-chat and ordered crispy green beans and calamari off of the appetizer menu .  i got the skinny margarita option .   ( i know ,  a girl who tries to watch her calorie in-take .  .  .  yawn .  )  but really ,  if you ' re wanting a margarita that ' s more sour than it is sweet - i ' d recommend it strictly for that reason and not because you ' re gonna save *maybe* 50 calories .  in terms of "skinny margarita" options - the only other one i ' ve come across in cleveland is at barrio - and yes ,  it ' s on the happy hour menu so you get it half priced at $3 . 50 as opposed to $7 .  so ,  yes it ' s cheaper than lopez .  but ,  you get less than you do at lopez .  so .  .  .  if you ' re looking for more bang for your buck .  .  .  or your just looking to get drunk .  .  .  ;- )     i digress .  .  .   service was fine - we weren ' t really in need of that much attention - once we had our drinks and snacks we were in good shape .  a water refill here and there ,  and besides that ,  no interruptions from staff or patrons .    i don ' t really know why it ' s been years since i ' ve been back to lopez .  the food was just like i remembered ,  actually ,  it was even better !  the green beans had a great batter on them and the calamari made me want to lick my fingers .    this is another great happy hour / ladies night destination to choose from .  i definitely want to go back again or make this a more regular stomping ground .    the only drawback to me ,  is metered parking in the cleveland heights neck-o-the-woods .  however ,  i heard a rumor that since cleveland is trying out the new credit-card swipe / mobile app pays .  .  .  we may not have to deal with this small annoyance for much longer !  ! 
__label__3 30 years ago when my parents took me to the original lopez y gonzalez i thought that mexican food was the greatest thing ever invented .   in fact the original impact has continued to set the standard for all mexican restaurants ever since .   i say all that to explain that it ' s a sad day when you cannot live up to you ' re own standards and i ' m afraid that lopez does not .   in my opinion mexican food should be both rustic and flavorful .   lopez has decided to take a cuisine with humble beginnings and tried elevated to the level of fine dining ,  losing all the elements that makes mexican food special .   if you are looking for a tasty fusion restaurant with mexican roots then lopez is a nice choice . 
__label__1 after we paid for parking out front ,  the hostess sat us with menus and got drinks we were finally informed that they don ' t serve food for another hour !  went there at 4:30 for happy hour .  we left because we were so hungry .  the waiter was explaining it to us ,  said sorry and the hostess was laughing as we walked out the door . 
__label__3 went here on a thursday night for happy hour .  the tequila selection was impressive ,  and half price margaritas on tues and thurs nights are good ,  but the food seemed mediocre to me .  the food selections were a mix of american / mexican / tex-mex fare  ( such as the kobe burger with chipotle mayo )  .    would go back for half price margaritas ,  but would not go back to eat . 
__label__4 pretty cool .  my son and i spent a few hours here before a browns game .  neat ship ,  and lots of cool stuff to see .  nice staff . 
__label__5 what a great museum !   this ship is like a time capsule .   it is as if the crew walked off the boat yesterday .   what a great day out and an interesting tour .  the tour guides were full of  anecdotes ,  and were obviously passionate about the boat and shipping history on the great lakes .   it is easy to get to  ( right behind the great lakes science center )  with their attached parking garage ,  etc .  ,  right there .   a must-see for cleveland in the summer . 
__label__2 over the last year i have gotten a number of the bakery items: pastries ,  small pieces of cake ,  cookies as well as a few cafe items .   the cookies were very disappointing dry and bland & even my kids didn ' t want to eat the sugar cookies .   some of the desserts have been very good ,  but others looked much better than they tasted .   after trying about 5 different side & main dishes with none being ones we wanted again ,  i decided to just get desserts & bread .   their breads are nothing special .   i even tried  their vanilla gelato which was just ok ,  & not as good as mitchell ' s ice cream which is half the cost .    my final straw came this past weekend when i got a coconut macaroon .   i couldn ' t wait to have it as a lunch dessert with a cup of tea .  one bite was all i needed .  .  . it was dry and rubbery with a burnt taste .   i turned it over and saw that the bottom was burned  ( included a picture )  .  i then realized that the coconut on the top was all singed ,  but it was hidden under a lot of powdered sugar !   very disappointed !   there are too many other fine bakeries in the area to put up with that . 
__label__4 this is a great lunch spot in an area low on  good ,  homemade food  ( i . e .  ,  the depressing drech of mayfield )  .  the wedding soup is the best i ' ve had and  the  prepared dishes such as chicken marasala iarequite tasty .  i always pick up a  selection of dolce -- adore the pine nut almond cookies --  for dessert later in the evening .  it ' s also reather pleasant to sit in the warmer weather with the glass doors open .  it reminds me a bit of the sort of places we love to have casual lunches in italian cities -- where the locals go for a quick ,  homemade lunch -- some pasta ,  a cold salad maybe .  i like the system of charging by the weight  -- good for portion control . 
__label__4 lovely bakery ,  and amazing pastry !   i bought a little pick me up for a friend ,  after she had her baby .   she loved it .   i will surely go back .  the selection is unreal and the counter help is wonderful . 
__label__5 this place is amazing !  favorite dishes: beet / mushroom / quinoa patties with verde salsa ,  chicken marsala ,  pesto tortellini ,  buffalo chicken bites .  .  .   bakery department is gorgeous ,  excellent espresso .  .  .   today i visited and i wanted the buffalo chicken bites ,  but none were prepared .  the owner whipped up a batch right away !  impeccable service .  i just love it ! 
__label__1 while we have gotten good pastries and bread in the past ,  we just bought an almond flavored cake .  it  was in the cooler .  both the cake and icing tasted stale and weeks-old .   we did not call them or give them a chance to do right .   also it was very small for $17 .  but it was so stale tasting any price was too much . 
__label__5 awesome place .  trustworthy and fair .  i won ' t take my car anywhere else .   they never try to sell me repairs or parts i don ' t need and i can always count on them to be the most reasonably priced place around .   a synthetic oil change will only run you just over $40 out the door ,  nowhere else comes close to that . 
__label__4 our meals were delicious and service excellent .   the trout was as good as always .   another excellent meal with good service on their wonderful patio .   a slight problem with the food order was promptly and cheerfully resolved .   another good meal and service ,  although the menu has more tex-mex varieties  on the printed menu and different choices on the daily specials .   the old menu was better . 
__label__5 castro ' s hardware is an amazing family owned neighborhood hardware store that has survived and thrived for over 20 years despite the onslaught of big box know nothing retailers like hd and lowe ' s .  olga can answer any plumbing question you throw her way .  norberto has been known to replace the glass in a window in 30 minutes .  the front of the store is filled with tomato plants ,  tomatoes ,  plantains  ( depending on the season )  and souvenirs from puerto rico .  they are all about excellent knowledgeable customer service and they have almost anything you need for home repair ,  can make very useful suggestions and do not ever try to talk you into buying something you do not need .  they cheerfully work long long hours and yes they did build that ! 
__label__1 no vegetables ?   not an onion ,  a pepper ?   overall a very boring selection .   no wonder i was the only one there
__label__5 great little place right up against the cleveland clinic campus .  stopped in for a quick bit and some coffee .  stop in and say hello if your ever close by . 
__label__3 the pad thai was disappointingly bland and tasteless ,  and the peanut sauce just wasn ' t right .   while i won ' t argue that everything looked and tasted fresh ,  the food was simply not authentic . 
__label__4 second time we ' ve eaten here; first was dine in .   don ' t judge them on the decor or the disposable dinnerware .   the food on the saturday afternoon buffet was absolutely delicious .   it prompted our return two weeks later for take-out .   again ,  absolutely delicious .   the gentleman that helped us both times  ( i ' m pretty sure it ' s the owner )  couldn ' t have been more kind and informative ,  and that really adds to an experience for me . 
__label__5 previous posters are correct .  .  . as good as it gets in the cle area .   finally a gourmet market that serves top-notch steaks ,  fish ,  sushi ,  desserts ,  pasta ,  and the best of locally-made stuff .   there are also unique veggies  ( purple beans )  .   i could have dropped a small mint in that place .   it is nice to have this place on the east side where i can pick up many things in one stop .   if i ever got uber lazy and skipped cooking for a dinner party this place has some killer great options .   prices are high and they will put a dent in your wallet but if it is quality you seek then don ' t worry about it and shop here .   prime filets $18 . 99 per pound .   and sushi made-to-order . 
__label__4 finally got to eat at nosh today .   i have heard this was one of the better food trucks .  .  . now i agree .   portion meets price point .   i do say the speed of pass leaves more to be desired .   this however has been common to all food trucks i ' ve dined with so far .   the food is american fare with an artistic chefy twist .   i would definitely come back .   today i had chicken fajita taco .  .  . great seasoninings ,  good porition .   that ' s all i had ,  the fried bologna was calling me but my healthy food choice won out for today .   wish it was greek yogurt opposed to sour cream on the taco .  .  . but that ' s another blog   p . s .  its cash only ,  kind of a drawback
__label__1 providing this disaster of a restaurant with 1 star is generous .  how in the world with a "build your own" sandwich can you completely botch the order ?  i ordered possibly the easiest order for them to date .  bread ,  turkey ,  veggies ,  cheese ,  mayo / mustard ,  very specifically ordered "no pork" .    my order was "to-go" or "carry-out" and i was in a hurry so didn ' t think about checking for accuracy .  i go to car ,  drive away 30 mins or so to my destination and go to eat my food .  i got pepperoni ,  ham ?  ,  wasn ' t turkey for sure ,  and grease .  bread was so soggy i couldn ' t even unwrap it .  pathetic .  thanks for the waste of time ,  money ,  and energy writing such a poor review .  #donoteathere
__label__4 everything here screams fresh .  the lemonade ,  fries ,  and made to order subs .  i came around 8pm the area was clean order was made fast . 
__label__5 i had the beef and chicken combo dish with pita ,  and it was really good especially for the price .  also two thumbs up for the friendly waitress who suggested this dish .  next time i ' m passing through cleveland and i ' m near an aladdin ' s ,  i ' ll have to try their other dishes .  too bad they don ' t have a chain in my neighborhood in california .  oh ,  well .  otherwise bon appetit ! 
__label__5 the food and service here is great !   i had a sampler plate with jasmin ' s rice and salad and it was very tasty and a large portion too .  i would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in the area . 
__label__4 this is a small farmers market with lots of tasty products for sell .  vendors are very kind and helpful with shopping .  the prices are reasonable as well . 
__label__5 had a really fresh espresso from tabu one afternoon after lunch @ porcelli ' s which is attached to tabu .  stopped in today for an americano and was pleasantly surprised that tabu was open and did not have to wait for my beverage .  great service ,  close to our location and great hours .  definitely recommend . 
__label__3 food is trying to be healthy but the microwave chicken kind of a turnoff .  staff friendly enough .  not much food for the price .  menu all over the place .  sometimes to many items are a bad thing .    smoothies -- it ' s no jumbo juice .  love cali one .  it ' s decent . 
__label__3 nice healthy lunch option near my work .   smoothies are very good and so are the rice bowls .   when i ' m in the mood for a sandwich- i get the sunny !   the workers are usually very friendly and helpful .   i would give them a 4 star rating if they had the nutritional information available for the menu items . 
__label__1 ordered a diy shirt on may 9 ,  2016 and today is july 11 ,  2016 and i have still not received my shirt .  emailed the company twice and received no responses .   their website is no inactive .   tweeted their account and nothing .   now looking at the reviews ,  i see i should have never ordered from this "company" .  now that it has been so long my bank may not even refund me .  i waited for a while just in case they lost my order .   i was giving them the benefit of the doubt but whoever is running this "company" is not a good person .   beware . 
__label__1 this company is still scamming people out of online orders to this day .  i even had the owner completely lie to me over multiple text message and phone calls and pretend to ship out my order .  they even sent me a picture message of a fake tracking number .  luckily my bank took care of me when i filed a claim ,  but they still post on instagram and twitter and facebook to this day and they try to get sales but they never actually ship anyone ' s order out .  they use different paypal names to keep changing it up so they can keep scamming people .  the owner even has a public instagram and facebook that he posts on even while he ' s scamming people .   here is the owner ' s personal instagram and twitter:  https: /  / instagram . com / justinhustle /  https: /  / twitter . com / justinhustle
__label__4 love me some aladdin ' s food .  lousy location ,  most people miss it in the plaza with panera ,  aldi ,  and the movie theater .  would be great if they added a location over on front street by the college and a delivery service would make me order much more often .   always great food ,  natural ingredients .  service can come & go .  .  .  . young servers often ,  others are stellar .  never fails to make me want to order everything on the menu .  inexpensive and definitely worth it .  i suggest adding hot sauce to almost anything .  the hot sauce rocks . 
__label__5 everything everyone else said is accurate .  nice restaurant .  great and varied menu - very vegetarian friendly .  awesome sauces ! 
__label__5 as a vegan i eat at aladdins regularly and am never disappointed .    today ,  i was in a fix with a late minute take out order for a party and mary went over and above her job to help me out with a container and serving spoon .   what a gem !   aladdins is lucky to have her .   i love this place for its great food and exceptional service ! 
__label__5 as this is a small chain ,  my husband i weren ' t expecting much when we ate here .   the place is super casual ,  the menus look like chain restaurant menus ,  and the food is almost too affordable .   but ,  we arrived at our hotel down the street and thought we might be meeting with other people later that night and thus wanted a quick meal .   we hoped the food would at least be ok and ended up being shocked by how good the food was .   i had a falafel salad ,  and my husband had a falafel roll and a salad .   the server was always on top of taking care of us ,  filled our waters when needed ,  and even lowered a blind to prevent the sun from being in my eyes .   now my only hope is that the chain will get so successful it will expand to new york state . 
__label__5 one of the best middle eastern places ever .  pleasant staff and quick service . 
__label__5 excellent service excellent meal !  i would highly recommend .  try the diamond baklava it is one of the best
__label__5 oh boy .  .  i have been here so many times and yet every time i crave for something different from indian food yet close to it in texture and taste ,  i come here .  .    their good is delicious and the staff are amazing .  do try their chicken curry shawarma roll and cheese cake .  . 
__label__3 one of the few places in the cleveland area where you can order fresh vegetable juice .  they offer a combo of carrot ,  celery ,  and spinach but it ' s mostly carrot . 
__label__3 gorgeous ,  historic building with a somewhat boring mix of shops and other businesses .  .  .  chiropractor ,  shop for coin collectors ,  tailor ,  leasing office - not a huge public draw unless you ' re in the market for coins or a new suit .  apparently ,  much of the space is owned by the adjacent hyatt .   i came here in the middle of the day and very few of the shops were even open ,  which seemed pretty odd to me .  still ,  walking through this extraordinary space was a fun experience . 
__label__2 fat fish blue is one of those places i ' ve always walked past and assumed was bad .   through their hazy windows ,  all i could see were crappy looking streamers ,  tiki statues and no patrons .   anyway ,  my husband had a groupon and we decided to check this place out and i have to say i was  pleasantly surprised .   the food wasn ' t terrible but it wasn ' t entirely awful .   second ,  the place was pretty empty so service was quick .   and third of all ,  the groupon didn ' t have any exclusions when it came to alcohol soooooooo .  .  . bottoms up !   we ordered the  cornbread  ( a little dry and bland but not entirely indigestible )  and crab cakes as an appetizer .   again ,  neither was terrible but neither was awful either .   just average .   for a main course ,  i ordered the caesar salad with blackened salmon along with a glass of pinot noir .   holy disproportions ,  batman !  my salmon was about 1 / 20th the size of my salad .   don ' t get me wrong ,  the salad was good and the salmon ,  what little portion was there ,  was also tasty .   just didn ' t expect ffb to be so stingy about it .   either way ,  the meal ,  while edible and pretty good ,  was just average .   if you feel like just shoveling some food in your mouth ,  or want to go somewhere that ' s light on crowds ,  haha ,  ffb is your place . 
__label__5 wow !  it was sooo great !  such a good fish ,  great stuff !  was in cleveland for a conference and went there for dinner ,  it is downtown in a very nice location ,  the atmosphere and the food was just great !  and you have a little surprise rolled into your napkin waiting for you !  yay ! 
__label__4 a bunch of us out-of-towners went here on a friday night for dinner and to listen to some music .  the food was good but nothing superb that i would come back for .  its difficult after eating gumbo in new orleans to have it anywhere else .  this place has a party atmosphere to it and their drink selection is large .  glad we came here to check it out .  .  . did it once ,  dont have to do it again . 
__label__2 great jambalaya .  great gumbo .  that ' s about it .  the band we happened to catch that night was absolutely horrendous .  out of tune and barely knew what they were doing .  it ' s also a pain in the butt to have to pay for parking and the cover charge . 
__label__5 the nice lady employee took her time with us ,  let us sample so many delicious dried fruit and vegetables .  so many were delicious .  the best part is there was no added sugar in the fruit .  the plantation bananas tasted a bit like potato chips .  we left we so many different treats .  i wish they ship their goods .  we lived the sweet potato ,  pineapple ,  strawberries ,  mango ,  papaya ,  bananas and more .  we live in michigan and wish they were closer .   many dried fruit has so much added sugar .  definitely a place to go to .  they are at stands 43-45 .  there fresh fruit was wonderful as well .  such a pleasure to work with this company and after 2 weeks ,  we have eaten all our goods !  would love to order from them for healthy snacks and a great food for eating on the hiking trails . 
__label__1 updating my review to play fair:  on 12 / 16 / 13 ,  a box arrived with another order of cards .   so the customer service representative did try to accommodate . 
__label__4 yummm .  i love hole in the wall restaurants .  .  there are a lot of places in the hood you might pass on your way to work and never think about .  .  this is one of them .  it ' s on the corner  ( in the cut )  next to a martial arts dojo .  i got the chicken philly .  i was bomb !  !  !  very messy and poorly organized but that is the only reason it doesn ' t get the last star .  looks aside it tasted great .  i ' d recommend getting the hot pepper for a  ( free )  added kick .  the chicken was juicy and tender so i ' ll definitely return .  half a sub costs 6 but it come with a drink and fry .  they only have three drinks right now so you might want to buy another .  stop by the people who work there are cool and will help you choose what to get or answer any questions you may have  ! 
__label__5 best damn cheese steaks ,  period !   you will be satisfied .  fries and drinks are included with your meal !  the chicken steak is awesome ! 
__label__4 i like bounce .  but seriously .  sometimes .  .  .  .  you just want to dance .  bounce is not that space .  never ending drag shows all the time . 
__label__5 a singular experience .   this place is charming and surprisingly spacious inside .   we sat outside ,  however ,  because the weather was perfect .   since it ' s a bit "off the beaten path , " it ' s quiet enough outside to hold a conversation ,  and you don ' t have a ton of passers-by gawking at your meal .   and ,  trust me ,  there ' s plenty to gawk at -- the food looks amazing and tastes even better .      we started with the baba ganoush -- which was creamy ,  thick ,  and tasty ,  but the pita that accompanied it was an experience in itself: warm ,  toasty ,  fresh .  .  . and plentiful !   they give you a ton of pita and will gladly provide more .  for my main course ,  i got the chicken kebab with yogurt .   the chicken was perfectly cooked and the yogurt was rich and flavorful .   my boyfriend got the lamb kebab with yogurt and loved it .   as much as we would have liked to eat our whole plates in one sitting ,  the portions were large enough that we had left overs .   wish we hadn ' t stuffed ourselves so we could have tried dessert !    we actually came to tremont to try bac ,  which got excellent reviews on yelp .  however ,  we got there and ,  in the short period of time between us walking in and being greeted by a hostess ,  we deemed it "too hip . "  it looked sleek and modern and some weird techno music was blasting -- we would seriously have felt like a couple of posers hanging out there .   istanbul grill is great because it ' s simple .   it ' s not a restaurant trying to be a hip nightclub . 
__label__5 good food ,  excellent service ,  and a delightful ambiance . 
__label__5 if you want an authentic italian restoring your favorite pair of shoes to like new quality ,  then this is the place for you !    i was visiting family in cleveland and broke a heel the day before my sister ' s wedding .  everyone said i had to take it to gino ,  so i did .  i could not have been more surprised at how wonderful he treated me .  he knew it was an emergency and fixed my shoe within the hour and for barely nothing .    you just don ' t get this kind of quality service anymore .  the best !  ! 
__label__5 gino ' s is by far the best shoe repair in town - well worth a drive out to kamm ' s corners .  excellent work ,  quick service ,  and bizarrely low prices .  i honestly don ' t even know how this place stays open with how little they charge for their services .  note that they are only open certain days - their hours are a little funny . 
__label__5 was thoroughly impressed !  the food is fantastic and reasonably priced .  a great representation of many indian foods on the menu .  tried several things including their take on aloo gobi ,  chana masala and their house / traditional dal .  everything was delicious .  love that it ' s in tremont and can easily walk to have a drink afterward .  they also have a full bar . 
__label__5 finally !   great indian food in tremont .  the food is impeccable .  the service was outstanding .   the drinks were top notch .  i can ' t say enough about this place .  their lunch buffet is better up there with the best i have ever been too .  you won ' t go wrong here . 
__label__5 papad and chutney served when you sit down .  it ' s free .    i loved the manchurian gobi and hubby loved apollo fish as appetizers .  i found the manchurian gobi to be more similar to the gobi 65 i have had at other restaurants  ( vancouver ,  nyc ,  maryland )  than the gobi 65 they offer .  their manchurian gobi is sauced and has some bell pepper and onions also .  their gobi 65 is fried spicy cauliflower without sauce .  i ' ve had both and prefer their manchurian version .    hubby loves the afghani lambchops .  they looked good to me ,  and i ' m a vegetarian !   i enjoyed my paneer butter masala and a black currant martini .  they had 5 indian beers on offer .  some restaurants skate by with just taj mahal and maybe 1 other .  husband appreciated the extra options .    i had kashmiri naan as my dessert .  yes ,  it wasn ' t listed as dessert ,  but it ' s sweet so why not .  hubby had carrot halwa .  he said it was great .     key point:  be careful with the spice level you order .  they ask you how much spice you want on a 1 to 10 scale .  my husband likes "thai hot" thai food ,  atomic bomb wings ,  and full on hot mexican peppers .  i ' ve seen him drink hot sauce  ( from the bottle )  .   he got a level 7 and said it was perfect .  go higher than that at your own risk .  i suspect it will clear your sinuses .  i had a medium level at 5 .   finding the right spice level might take trial and error and will be restaurant specific .    i would err on the mild side myself .   just know if you order your food too spicy ,  you won ' t taste anything except hotness .  your eyes will water ,  and your nose won ' t stop running .  good luck and have fun with it ! 
__label__1 i had the same experience as olwen c .  when i tried to eat at tandul last week .   their website and even the hours on the front door said they should be open ,  but they were not .   left very annoyed that i wasted my time driving there .     make sure you call first ! 
__label__5 great indian food .  get a tikki masala of some kind if you ' ve never been before .  order it spicey  ( 8 / 10 or hotter )  and then get some garlic or cheese naan and dig in .    you can order extra rice ,  two orders of naan and split one masala meal . 
__label__5 showed up late on sat night without reservations and were able to score the "private" seating room with 4 people and a baby .   everything is delicious and service is excellent .  from the nice light crackers in the beginning  ( spiced really nicely )  ,  to the delicious buttery garlic naan  ( excellent ,  skip the roti which is a bit chewy )  ,  to the really spicy lamb curry  ( almost too spicy )  ,  buttery buttery vegetable filled veggie briyani  ( go for the biryani and skip the regular basmati rice ,  you won ' t regret )  ,  to really delicious paneer .  .  . just overall amazing .  my only small complaint was the tandoori chicken was a little too much on the bone-heavy side  ( which they had more pieces of breast meat or maybe they shredded the chicken off the bone )  .    overall ,  delicious food here . 
__label__4 wow .  great food !  the chicken tikka masala is a safe  ( and delicious )  bet ,  but everything i ' ve tried ,  from the goat vindaloo ,  to the afghani lamb chops ,  to the tandoori shimp are incredible .  don ' t be afraid to branch out here !  also ,  if you ' re looking for a happy hour snack ,  the samosa and gobi 65 appetizers are perfect with a cold beer .  i get fierce cravings for indian food on a weekly basis ,  and this place has blown me away each time .    however ,  since they ' re a new restaurant ,  there have been some issues with service .  never any rudeness - and this absolutely should not deter you from checking tandul out - but in the few times i ' ve been there ,  the kitchen and waitstaff have some communication issues ,  leading to some timing problems .  for example ,  last time i was there ,  the shrimp and lamb were served first  ( both being quick cooking dishes )  ,  while the curries took considerably longer .  basic timing mistake ,  but i chalk it up to "new restaurant" issues .  by the time you read this ,  they ' ll probably have many of these issues ironed out .   go check tandul out .  if nothing else ,  it ' s a great changeup from the other options on professor ave . 
__label__5 spectacular food ,  kind-but-unobtrusive service ,  easy parking ,  no wait and great drinks .   5 stars definitely . 
__label__5 went back for dinner last night and everything was on point .   we had the mushroom appetizer again and the owner remembered that i like my food very spicy and he made the app super spicy .   it was fantastic !   husband and i each had a chettinad ,  i had veggie and he had chicken .   mine was made spicy  ( it could have used a bit more heat ,  but it was spicy nonetheless )  and it was just delicious .   the husband liked mine so much that he kept eating it .   the bells two hearted on draft was a perfect compliment to the heat .   we also shared the naan with green chilies in it and it was great as well .   service here is excellent .   highly recommended . 
__label__5 this was my second time trying the buffet .  they change the buffet menu daily !  and it ' s only $9 . 99 .  everything we tried was delicious .  buttered naan ,  lollipop chicken ,  paneer ,  spicy fried peppers .  service was great .  so glad good indian food has made it to tremont . 
__label__2 the food is mediocre at best .  there are plenty of better indian restaurants in cleveland  ( cafe tandoor ,  choolah and saffron patch to name just a few )  .   poor service made the entire experience worse .  considering how expensive indian food generally is ,  we had hoped for more .    there was one woman taking orders for a large portion of the restaurant .  drinks took half-an-hour to arrive .  the server did not seem to write down our appetizer order and dinner showed up and ended up just being so-so  ( the sauces were under-spiced and not very distinctive )  . 
__label__5 great food in a nice atmosphere .   mango lassi and tandoor items were fantastic .   really sweet server named tom ,  as well as kindness from other hosts / servers .   will be back ! 
__label__2 poor service .  we were told it was happy hour when we walked in this evening .  once we sat and looked at the bar menu our server told us happy hour was over .  he could have still honored the drinks .  the food was just okay .  won ' t be dining here again . 
__label__3 marc ' s sells a lot of really good stuff here for really cheap prices .   however ,  while they have many categories of items ,  they ' re limited in their selection .   for example ,  they ' ll have product x ,  but only have one option for picking it out .   the produce here is pretty terrible and old-looking .   the biggest downside is that they don ' t take credit cards .   you have to pay with cash ,  in-state checks ,  or discover .   i don ' t plan on really grocery shopping here; it ' s not worth it to save a total of $3 with the inconvenience of going elsewhere to get other quality foods . 
__label__1 this place is terrible .    1 .  )  doesn ' t take credit cards 2 .  )  atm fee is overpriced 3 .  )  prices are very very bad 4 .  )  doesn ' t do simple grocery store expected services like give out rolls of quarters 5 .  )  staff cares zero about customers ,  customer service ,  politeness 6 .  )  horrible selection  if you were to translate the mentality of an exploitive slumlord landlord ,  who knows he has poor people by the neck and has no reason to let up on them ,  that is the leadership and ownership of marc ' s .   with a wonderful place like zagara ' s less than a mile away ,  i ' m amazed that anyone even goes into this place .  even the dave ' s at cedar-fairmount is better . 
__label__4 perfectly nestled at the bottom of the lakewood hts blvd loop on berea rd is an adult book and novelty store called your fantasies .  ever since i was a kid ,  i was blown away that lakewood had something so erotic and accessible right at the bottom of that little loop ,  beyond city limits .  i have not yet been in the store .  i can imagine once the internet came out ,  stores like this must have taken a hit .  luckily ,  there are still people that want some of the crazy stuff they have within the walls of "your fantasies" .  it is within a one minute drive of the famed lido lounge .  that sounds like a perfect night out in cleveland ,  cheese steak at nearby penn station ,  a few drinks and dances at the lido and finish the night off at "your fantasies" .  please support local owned businesses like this .  don ' t order off the internet ,  or those all girl toy parties .  come out in the light of day ,  let people driving by who are going to pat catans or paramount distillers see you come out of that store with a bag of goodies .  you are the person who is willing to go out in public to buy stuff so you may live out your fantasies . 
__label__4 i am not sure why applebee ' s gets such a bad rap .  .  i have never had a bad meal here and the drinks are consistent and good .  i realize its a chain and owned by an evil corporation out to destroy mom and pop businesses .  .  but the appetizers are pretty tasty .  .   i like this location because it is close to where i live and has a pretty good view .  prices are decent and when they have one of those "if your server doesn ' t mention x then you get a free x" ,  your server will most certainly not mention what ever it was they were supposed to .  .  i get a lot of free crap here . 
__label__5 showed up just over an hour after i called near 4 pm ,  re-arranged a regular workout plan at 6:30 so that i wouldn ' t be left hanging ,  & got the job done in good time .   was friendly and dealt with my string of curious questions -- i ' m curious about how things work -- without being annoyed ,  just rolled with it .   end of the day . 
__label__5 jon was on time ,  efficient ,  friendly ,  and charged a fair price .   local clevelanders should always choose local clevelanders
__label__5 i loved my experience at viaduct lounge !  we went there for drinks and appetizers ,  and had a nice table by the window .  the bacon wrapped figs were delicious ,  and the cocktail shrimp had such delicious ,  plump ,  fresh shrimp i couldn ' t even believe it !  they had excellent cocktails .  i definitely want to come back for dinner .  i highly recommend this place ! 
__label__4 i ordered a dirty martini here and it went a little something like this:   me: i ' d like a dirty martini ,  please ?  bartender: how dirty do you want it ?  me: filthy .  bartender: jenna jameson ,  filthy ?  me: yes .  please .   he made sure that my olive was stuffed ,  and brimming with the softest blue cheese on this side of the cuyahoga river .   it was probably the best dirty martini i have ever had .   ( and no ,  i don ' t say that to all of the bartenders .  )   i can only imagine what it would have been like if i asked for it ke$ha dirty .  .  . 
__label__5 i love this place !   i ' ve been 3 times so far for fillings and a root canal .  and all 3 times everyone was so incredibly nice and welcoming !  !  xavier has done all of my feelings and he ' s so sweet and nice as well as the main dentist !  the main dentist is the nicest man ever .  this is the place to go
__label__4 the skinny: the excellent char siew  ( bbq pork & duck )  at the deli here bumped it up from 3-star to 4 .   in comparison to nearby competitor park to shop ,  family-run asia food co .  carries fewer varieties of asian dry goods and snacks but offers meat and produce superior in quality as well as a more relaxed ,  spacious and better ventilated shopping experience .  customer service is also very friendly ,  prompt ,  and helpful .   the long of it: decent asian supermarket with well-kept meat counter and deli--will suffice for any foodie looking to brew up some asian concoctions at home or looking to grab a quick ,  delicious meal ,  cafeteria-style .   asia food co .  ' s selection of produce ,  frozen and dry goods is satisfactory ,  though i must agree with fellow yelpers: there was something unsettling about the handful of empty shelves interspersed throughout the aisles .   better display management or stocking practices ,  and you ' re up to a five-star review !   i ' ve been to my fair share of asian grocery stores ,  and the meat / butcher ' s counter here stood out for me .   all the meat and seafood looked clean and fresh and best of all ,  there wasn ' t even the slightest whiff of raw meat that you ' ll normally find at the butcher counter of say ,  a giant eagle .   proper refrigeration ,  an airy ,  open layout ,  and full ventilation throughout the market no doubt lead to this rarest and rather disconcerting phenomenon: an odor-free asian supermarket .   sans the usual funky overtones of asian herbs ,  spices ,  and ripening meat stewing at room temperature ,  asia food co .  won the approval of even my bf ' s non-asian olfactory preferences .   the hot deli and bakery section at the back of the market is equally outstanding .   we ' d actually been initially lured by the fact that the former owner of the market  ( mr .  duong )  now mans the char siew counter  ( while his son and daughter manage the daily operations of the market )  .   we ordered a pound of pork char siew and half a roast duck--the taciturn ,  cleaver-adept mr .  duong even threw in extra sauce to go with the duck .   both our deli orders were succulent and well-seasoned--a real hit .    while park to shop down the street holds a wider selection of asian household products ,  snacks ,  dry goods ,  and produce--not to mention that it ' s in the same shopping center as our favorite dim sum hangout li wah--and asia food co .  evinces the air of a half-renovated ,  half-stocked work-in-progress ,  the latter is noteworthy for its excellent onsite chinese barbecue and well-attended meat and seafood sections .   i ' ll definitely be returning for my general asian grocery needs ,  even if it means traveling a little farther after dim sum runs ! 
__label__5 this place is a foodie dream !  the aisles are filled with every conceivable type of sauce ,  noodle ,  vegetable ,  fruit ,  mushroom and steam bun !  everything is clean ,  the staff are very friendly if you need a little help .  a must for any amateur cook ! 
__label__5 this is a very unique and specialty retailer in the heart of cleveland ohio .   this boutique is co-owned by a former dj and radio personality and an avant guard fashion designer-tom bayne .    custom and specialty products can be found here and if you talk with tom-he can custom design something for your taste as well !   a very unique and custom service for the cleveland ,  ohio area .    they have awesome rings and unique t-shirts as well as custom bayne wear designed by tom .   they have an extensive line of adult dvd ' s  ( gay and straight )  as well as a wealth of products that will cater to all ages and demographics .   consider this store a go to source for any type of speciality product-they are the 911 and the go to people in cleveland ,  ohio .    they will custom make leather products for a leather event or you can buy off the rack bayne wear that is really custom designed attire that is really a show stopper for a night on the town .    a must see for anyone looking for unique and specialty products that are not sold elsewhere !    if you have a question about the city as well they are very down to earth people and will direct you to the correct resource to make you stay in cleveland extra special .   awesome windows displays on halloween and christmas as well designed by tom- a must see during the holidays ! 
__label__5 my husband and i are new to ohio and had no idea where to start .  mike was extremely friendly while showing us homes and was on top of everything .  mike definitely made us feel like a priority during the process .  once we found our dream home ,  mike showed us his negotiating skills and our offer was accepted .  clare walked us through everything that we had to finish with detailed timelines to avoid anything going wrong . 
__label__4 how could you not go wrong .  .  with anna ' s fabulous believe in healthy food for her customers and ever present happiness .  i love everything she does with her menu .  she offers secret passwords for daily discounts and lives life with  fun and love of family .  the decor is filled with some very nice local sports legends and her family in a bright and cheerful setting . 
__label__4 located on st .  clair  ( more appropriately st .  sleaze street )  ,  the leather stallion is the old standby bar of the gay leathermen / levy crowd .  it ' s been home base to a few of the gay motorcycle clubs like the unicorns and a general watering hole for the "bear , " s&m ,  bdsm crowd for many years .  but ,  as with most bars of this type ,  gradually slipping out of fashion and style with the younger uninitiated set .    you don ' t enter through the front door .  instead you proceed down a small alleyway entering through a side door or ,  at times ,  going to the end of the alleyway there is an open entrance directly onto a large outdoor patio area .    the leather stallion is generally a fun place to visit even if you aren ' t a part of the leather crowd .  indeed ,  it is now home bar for a good number of gay leather queen or leather lite wannabe types discovering their way through the leather circuit of life .    the place opens daily at 4:00pm regardless that the front door says 3:00pm .  on weekends they used to have great ,  really fun type barbecues  ( technically grilling )  with offerings of hamburgers .  leave it to some leather queen to be unable to get the signs coordinated for nearly a decade .    the patio area is large with yet a patio bar out back .  there are plenty of tables and in the patio and because of the ivy shrouded walls surrounding the patio area ,  has a very pleasant outdoorsy type of ambiance to it .   the inside area has a lobby of sorts and you step down into the main bar .   most of the patrons are fun loving ,  pleased to meet newcomers and enter into conversation .   the place has been here seemingly forever ,  and because it is rather popular i am amazed that i am the first to review it . 
__label__4 i literally stumbled upon this place and couldn ' t be happier .  why is it so hard to find a threading place in cleveland ?  this place was clean ,  quick and i was pleased with the work they did on my brows .  $10 and quick in and out ,  no wait ! 
__label__2 make an appt .  !  i liked it the first two times and had no problem walking in .  showed up today to a "be back in 15 minutes" post-it note on the door .  not sure what time that was even written ,  so i waited an extra 25 because i wanted them done and had time .  no one came .  headed to a professional salon ! 
__label__4 convenient location- i was able to park in front & did not have to wait to get my eyebrows done .  prices were reasonable  ( $10 )  for eyebrow threading & efficient service .  clean .  will def go back
__label__4 this review is based on my experience during cleveland beer week 2015 .   dive bar is a dive bar .  i kind of expecting the worse and was pleasantly surprise .  it was clean and spacious .  maybe it was an event that need tickets to be pre purchased ,  everything was just so organized .   $20 for 4 pints and a snack .   the selection was quite impressive with 30+ beers to choose from .  there are 2 bar areas and we ended up hanging out at the back bar with an awesome bartender .  great service and always checked on us frequently .   the patrons and the staff were all so friendly to us .  this might be a different crowd compares to the normal dj nights ,  but we really have a good time drinking all our beers here ! 
__label__5 go here .  go here now !   we had such a fabulous time .  called ahead for reservations and they were adorably missed .  normally that would annoy me ,  but they were so nice and agreeable when we arrived that i quickly forgot .   they suggested the vegetable 555 as an appetizer and it was divine .  salty ,  smoky and spicy .  we also got the butter chicken  ( classic and delicious )  and the vegetable korma ,  followed by so much delicious naan i quickly forgot my name and slipped into a naan carb coma .   lovely ,  fun and flavorful .  go ! 
__label__5 go .  .  .  .  just go .  .  .  .  seriously though .  .  .  .  go !  !  !   ive had indian food in india .  .  .  and this place is beyond true to their roots ans beyond delicious .   when we went they didnt have a yelp page or we would have left a review then ! 
__label__5 delicious !  had chicken tikka masala & garlic naan- if you like spicy ,  i ' d ask for 7 or greater .  my fiance asked for 5 and felt it wasn ' t spicy at all . 
__label__5 very inviting place ,  eric  (  the manager i think  )  was very engaging with the group i was with .  he seemed to recognize a majority of the customers that came in during our time there .  the food was really good ,  had the club which was suggested by the young lady ,  my co-workers had the cheesesteak which they suggested i get upon our next visit . 
__label__3 staff was very friendly and the subs were good .  personally i feel that they are a little pricey considering its just a sub . 
__label__4 of the various bb&b stores i have been in the employees in this one seem to be the most helpful .  i have called this store when i am missing a part to something i bought and they have had it waiting at the register for me  ( even if i didn ' t originally buy it at this specific store location )  .  the have a huge selection of kcup coffee which is why i am in here most often .  and when someone wants a kitchen gadget  ( and since there isn ' t a sur la table nearby )  this store usually has what i need with several options to pick from no less .  there is usually an employee to be found within the first main isle to direct you to the part of the store you need to go to and on several occasions i have been walked by someone to the section i needed something in .  the store in general has seemed to relax their coupon policy now taking multiple coupons per checkout and letting you pick off which item you want the discount to be taken . 
__label__4 coming from nyc and already living in a high-rise ,  bridgeview is ok .   i ' ve lived here for three years now .  tenants are usually young professionals .  walls are thin ,  so you can hear your neighbors sometimes .  indoor parking is ok if you have a small car ,  otherwise an suv or larger will have trouble parking with the closely spaced and wide pillars .  alternative covered parking across the street is available and cheaper .  you are limited to directv for cable .  that means if there is a rain / snowstorm ,  your cable will go out .  if you ' re a sports fan ,  this may be a problem .  this happened to me during the superbowl and i could do nothing about it .  sid ,  the doorman is really nice and takes his job seriously and he remembers your name .   the newer hires are young and usually chatting on the phone and watching shows on their ipads .   packages are received and notification is sent to you via email and text .   coldroom is available if receiving groceries or flowers by mail ,  but whether they are stored there is at the discretion of who is at the front desk .  there isn ' t always a doorman at the front desk ie doorman does not equal security guard .  there ' s a gym  ( treadmills ,  ellipticals ,  mats )  and weight room included with rent .   rent has increased $40 / month every year since living here .  laundry room is available .   in-house washer and dryer is available for additional fee .  maintenance requests and rent are paid online .  utilities are paid on the  same website with a different username which is unnecessarily inconvenient .    regarding response to service requests ,  it depends .  emergent requests are dealt with in a timely fashion .  this includes clogged toliets .  personally ,  i have reported pipes leaking in the hallway ,  leaving puddles of water .   management responded that this was nothing to worry about .   the pipes ran to the garage ?  nevermind the mold and damage to the infrastructure of the building the water .   i put in a second request ,  this time stating this was a hazard .  someone could slip and fall .   response: placement of a bucket .  two years later ,  i have 2 buckets in my hallway .   what ' s wrong with fixing the pipes ?  this is also cleveland and the bridgeview house quite a few tenants .   there is a lot of foot traffic through the front door .   there ' s just one skinny floor mat ,  which is sufficient for sunny days .  if it rains or snows ,  this foyer becomes a slip and slide .  with the annual rent increase ,  why not invest in a larger floor mat or several floor mats ?     i obviously liked the place enough to stay .  it ' s an extremely convenient location .  walking distance from a large number of good restaurants ,  bars ,  quicken loans arena and the two stadiums ,  playhouse district and casino .  there ' s a grocery store next door with beer ,  wines ,  cheese ,  and basic essentials .  the river is just behind the building with a nice patch of grass and walking path .   tower city has a mini mall ,  the casino ,  and a train station that can take you directly to the airport .  i would say it ' s a safe area .  police patrol this area frequently bec of the nightlife .  traffic picks up during rush hour ,  sporting events ,  and marathons .  compared to nyc ,  it ' s no biggie .  trash chutes available on every other floor .   recycling is available behind mallorca restaurant if you ' re so inclined .   management also through a few social events every year with food and booze .  and the place is pet friendly with doggie treats at the front desk and dog waste bags at the front door . 
__label__2 i ' m looking to relocate my business ,  that ' s how i came across this building .  in my search of doorman building they came up and i called them to make sure they had 24 hours security or concierge ,  after being pet friendly 24 hours security is very important to me ,  i was told they do .  i made an appointment and i got to my appointment early .  i called and asked if they could show me their apartments earlier then our schedule appointment and was told to please come right in .  in a heavy down pour i went from front entrance back to street to go two doors down twice ,  get soaked and have the woman in the office tell me to go back to front entrance and she will be there in a second to meet me .  extremely soaked by now i waited in the lobby for 15 minutes and no one ever came over to receive me ,  being annoyed i left .   while waiting there i was told by the concierge woman that they only had security till 3 am .  so i don ' t know who was telling the truth here .   the lobby was large but lacked any charm of a welcome ,  it didn ' t even have a chair in the huge waiting area .  the building from the outside looked very old .  i still wanted to give them a chance since i had come a long way to change my opinion .  one should never judge a book by it ' s cover but i never was given the chance . 
__label__1 uugh ,  stay away from this place and the classy character that owns it .  he ' ll take your dvd player ,  take your deposit ,  keep it 4 weeks ,  tell you it ' s fixed ,  then tell you it ' s been moved  ' to the other building '  when you try to pick it up ,  then tell you it ' s working   ' most of the time '  when you come back to pick it up ,  then tell you he never really replaced the part  because the new part didn ' t work when you call to complain that your broken dvd player is still broken .   overall ,  i wasted 4 weeks and 3 trips across town to deal with this piece of work ,  and yes ,  my dvd player is still broken . 
__label__2 with my intense love for cleveland public library ' s main branch ,  this particular one just breaks my heart .  you ' d expect a smaller selection ,  but the disappointment goes way beyond that .    this branch is the closet one to where i live in ohio city .  it ' s convenient for a quick pick up or return ,  especially since i ' m just a short walk away .  for anything other than that ,  i make the trip downtown .   first of all ,  if you drive over here parking can be a nightmare .  there are three extremely popular cleveland restaurants right there ,  so as you can imagine ,  the street parking is rather limited .  and that ' s all there is .    ok ,  ok--i can handle the parking situation .  i ' m not too lazy to walk ,  especially since i ' m close .    what i cannot handle are the creepsters who always seem to be hanging around the outside .  really ?  is the local library branch the best place for trouble-makers to hang out ?  it ' s not much better inside either .  i have not gone to this location once without some guy saying something inappropriate to me ,  or being whistled at like a piece of meat .  actually ,  i came here for a reason and it wasn ' t to get picked up by scary looking dudes .  thanks ,  but no thanks .  i now refuse to go to this library alone .    the cleveland library is a great place to rent a movie for free without worrying about redbox ,  but i wouldn ' t go to this branch .  it ' s usually over taken by 25 unattended ,  loud children who ' s mothers are too busy trolling the interwebs to mind .  as much as i love children ,  i like i ' ll pass .    if you don ' t mind walking through a group of men staring at you or wrestling though groups of children to rent a movie ,  then it ' s not a bad place .  at least the librarians are super nice .  bless their hearts .  i ' m sure they put up with a ton of crap daily with that crowd . 
__label__3 definitely not a 5 star service .  did the work ,  cleaned my drain ,  but $300+ for 5 minute ' s work ?  i don ' t think you can call that honest .  the worst part is they said i can get a camera service but nobody contacted me in 5 days ,  and i called ,  they said the camera will call me back that day ,  no ,  its a lie .  i am still waiting and the t is uncovered with dirt scattered around in my yard ,  and rain .  .  .   its worth a try if you have no better choice ,  but not a good choice for my experience . 
__label__1 not even worth the star .  how is this place still open !  ?  !  ?  my husband ,  baby and i went for a quick dinner and waited till the 3 women upfront where done having their conversation before we where acknowledged and seated .  we where the only customers in the whole restaurant with 5 employees present .  we first ordered for our baby mac and cheese with a side of corn .  that came out quickly ,  after some time my husband and we ordered eggs in a basket no bacon for mine subtitiute with a side salad ,  he wanted to add a side of sausage gravy .  nothing too crazy and complicated .  .  .  .  . right ?  salad came out quickly but the lettuce was visably old ,  wilted and parts where very brown .  we watched and waited and we watched and waited some more .  .  .  .  .  .  . and then we watched and waited .  .  .  2 ppl in the kitchen and no food .  at this point we are getting upset .  we had been waiting well over 15 mins for what ?  ?  the place wasn ' t busy ,  we where the only customers there !   after waiting more than enough time we got up and went to the register visably upset and asked to pay for what was eaten .  nobody came to the register .   just then the food we ordered came to the window and the waitress who was standing right infront of the window pointed out that the food was ready .  well we can see that .  .  .  . we ' ve only been waiting for it .  we declined and said we just wanted to pay for what we ate and leave .  i explained that it ' s ridiculous to have to  wait that long when we are the only customers there ,  it ' s not like they where busy or understaffed .  everyone was too busy talking and doing sidework .  i ' ve worked as a server for many years ,  and as a prep cook ,  i ' m not ignorant to what goes on and timing of different foods .  after speaking to the waitress she went to ring us out for the total bill .  ummm wtf !  ?  ?  !  gtfo are you serious !  ?  !  we told her we where not paying the whole bill ,  only what we ate .  she said ok let me get my manager .  she asked for the manager who replied ,  wait a minute as she was too busy still in the kitchen packing the food into togo containers and cleaning up to be bothered to attend to us .  she eventually made her way out and didn ' t offer an apology but didn ' t argue either and proceeded to fix the bill .  discraceful .  shame on you .  we did leave a tip for what would be appropriate for what the bill would have been for the waitress because it wasn ' t her fault that the people in the kitchen where incompetent .  won ' t be back there just not worth it . 
__label__1 "yuck" would be the best way to describe this place .  walking to our table my shoes were literally sticking to the carpet .  the general scent was of a public restroom and i could see many booth seats just torn up .  i ' m glad i could put my 2 year old in the booster because it looked like the high chairs haven ' t been cleaned since they opened his place .  if we weren ' t so time pressured and had to shlep our little ones back to car ,  i would have never stayed .  i ' m not delusional and i have no big expectations from the food at denny ' s ,  but let ' s just say that after this visit ,  the bar went even further down .   i am never going back to this place . 
__label__1 christmas shopping and wrapping after work till 1am .  stop at denny ' s because i hadn ' t eaten since 9am before work; worst experience i ever had .  cook cranking bar hip hop over the christmas music playing on speakers .  .  .  . so two different musics competing and thennnn; waitress never brings bill so we walk up to register to pay our waitress .  she gives me one receipt and asks if i wanna add anything to it .  i asked her don ' t i put that on receipt ?  she tells me no we have an old system and says here you can put it on this one and hands me a different receipt .  husband says i have cash for tip to me .  i am now questioning the two different receipts and asked how much was my bill ,  how much did you charge me .  then she was fumbling through receipts and says oh i over charged you .  can i just give you cash back .  i ask "what do you mean ,  i don ' t understand ,  explain ? " she charged me 20% over my bill  ( bill was 20$ that she handed me but then rang it for 24$ and change )  lol then she tells me it wasn ' t for a tip it was a mistake  ( i didn ' t accuse her of anything i didn ' t say a word lol i just wanted to leave )  .  i went back and took the 7$ off the table and left the 4$ she accidentally over charged me and felt her self worth .  lol what a experience .  wow !  never again !  food was less than ok as well . 
__label__1 what a horribly miserable customer experience .  like every other person i ' ve found on the internet that has had any "interaction" with this company ,  i have invested hours of time waiting on the phone trying to speak with someone ,  anyone from customer service  ( or really ,  anybody at the company )  .  i would probably have far more luck just opening my window and yelling in the general direction of cleveland .   unfortunately ,  you have zero options with this company but to slowly waste your life away ,  stuck in the eternal automated telephone hell that seems to be this companies sole core competency . 
__label__1 i have been calling for the last 3 days attempting to speak to a customer rep .  endless hours on hold or a loop which reinitiates my call and puts me back to hold .  i ' ve left phone messages ,  sent notes .  .  . all to no avail .  this company is not customer focused to say the least .  i can ' t imagine trying to collect on a policy - this was the systems response to my note sent from their homepage - your message has been sent .  thank you for your email to selman & company .  we will review your message and you will receive a response if a response is required . 
__label__5 excellent !  very personable ,  reasonably price .  i showed her a picture ,  and she was able to do my hair exactly the same way- even matched my funny colored hair perfectly .  i will be back . 
__label__4 i swear to the gods of tuition that i never would have gotten through art school without pat catans ,  and there ' s no way i could afford my life without them either .  sometimes i even go here when i just need a nice little retail therapy browse .    the prices on craft materials ,  art supplies ,   ( and all kinds of other things )  cannot be beat .  you do need to learn the store because finding a helpful employee can be hard .  but the tradeoff is worth it .  if you are self-employed or own a business ,  get the tax exemption card for additional discounts .  same with the regular club card .    also ,  can you really beat a place that has an airbrushed 70s van in the parking lot ?  no .  you cannot . 
__label__3 for holidays i always try to have my lil one make gifts for the ladies in our family .   been here off and on a bunch of times .   always have new stuff and you can get some great ideas .   prices are pretty good as far as craft stores go .   off the beaten path on the near west side .   dont have to fight all the traffic and suburban mall warriors .   lido lounge is right around the corner so you can make an afternoon of it if you get down like that .  .  .  only thing that makes this place suck a little bit is the girls at the registers have the personality of a spam sandwich and last time i needed help finding something and the lady i asked was a twat and gave me tude the whole time she was showing me to the prosthetic hands and turky basters .  .  . dont ask .  . 
__label__1 kate ' s fish is absolutly terrible .  i visited the west side market yesterday and my mother was disrespected .  tommy  ( the owner ' s son )  had a very terrible attitude .  my mother asked to see what a certain type of fish and he showed it to her .  my mother asked him if he had any fresh non frozen fish and he said no and that all of the seafood products came from new zealand and that it was all frozen .  he immediately caught an attitude and rolled his eyes .  my mother said that she just asked a question and that there was no need to get an attitude .  he snapped at that point and said "well you should have known ! " my mothers feelings were hurt and she said "well excuse me for not going to the university of fish . " he immediately turned his back and said " black b****" and repeatedly kept saying have a nice day in a sarcastic tone .  my mother called the west side market management and a very nice lady automatically knew who we were talking about when we said "kate ' s fish" .  she said she would be in touch with kate and she also apologized for tommy ' s behavior .  tommy came over to us an apologized but you could tell it was not sincere .  no one should ever have to experience rudeness like that .  i wish i could put zero stars but sadly i cannot . 
__label__2 went here for the sushi grade fish ,  not the restaurant .  disappointing .  it seems that northeast ohio is not the place to look for sushi grade fish !  no one has anything but salmon ,  ahi tuna and maybe scallops .  same was true here even though i heard they had more .  i had emailed them prior to going but they never even replied . 
__label__3 the food is ok but the service is sub-par .  just had a horrible take out experience .  how is a chicken and steak burrito the same as three beef tacos .   it was a take out order so  course i didn ' t see the problem until i got home .  this is not the same as forgetting a taco or forgetting to put cheese on the taco .   not happy at all with this type of service .   i was basically ripped off since i paid for what i ordered and got something completely different in the end .    they just lost one customer and they may lose more if they don ' t change .   update .  .  .  . after speaking with the manager about what happen ,  he acknowledge that they messed up .  he explained my order was mixed up with another customer ' s order and he talked with his staff about better checking of orders before taking them out to customers .  they are back on good terms with me . 
__label__4 you ' ll find me here when i ' m craving cheap ,  no-nonsense mexican food .  i ' ve been here too many times to admit but the service is always consistently great .  i always get the same thing: fajitas .  the portion is huge and it ' s so so cheap .  they even have a "fajitas for dos" if you ' re into sharing .  the mixed vegetables and meat come out sizzlin '  and the best part is it isn ' t toooo greasy like what you may expect .  they will always bring out mas tortillas so you can take the rest home .  the margs are decent and yup ,  cheap .  great for group fiestas .  ia1oli ! 
__label__1 two years ago i went to hudec and at first was pleased with the efficient cleaning , exam , and x-rays .  i came back for a filling or something and suddenly was being strongly manipulated to get a crown ,  then another crown ,  then a third crown .  because i had medicaid at the time ,  i was only approved for sketchy metal crowns .  they absolutely mutilated my teeth and gums in order to cram the crowns in .  i still have cement i can feel with my tongue and they ground down two adjacent teeth to make the crowns fit without asking me so anything cold ,  hot ,  or very sweet feels like i ' m being stabbed on both sides of my mouth .  chewing is painful .  i have to make sure i only rinse with warm water when i brush my teeth .  i have to microwave listerine first .  if i breathe with my mouth open on a moderately cool day ,  the air makes my crowned teeth throb .    dr .  hardy spends as little amount of time as possible with patients and instructs his staff to drill drill drill .  at one point i was there for four hours and the anesthesia / novocain has stopped working and i could feel everything .  shot after shot of anesthetic did nothing .  my mouth was swollen and bleeding for days and my gums were bruised .  i was told it was because i have sensitive gums .  okay ?  did you go to dental school ?  do your job .  now i have infected teeth ,  crowns i can ' t floss between ,  constant pain ,  and no way to see a dentist to have this atrocious work corrected .  when i mess up at work ,  it ' s a problem .  apparently this level of skill and quality is acceptable at hudec dental . 
__label__1 if i were rating their pastries alone ,  i would give 3 stars .  the coffee ,  however ,  is extremely bitter ,  lacks flavor and is expensive .  never thought i would say this ,  but you ' re better off going to starbucks; it ' s both tastier and much cheaper . 
__label__2 a shiny coffee shop in the tinkham veale center ,  with a wide selection of baked goods .   iced tea rating: 2 / 5 stars .  tea was bitter and smoky ,  not remarkable .   ( but did not taste like coffee .  )  $2 . 50 per 16 oz . 
__label__5 mely ' s kainan is cash only with a single table set up if you choose to dine in .  this is mostly a carry out style business .  i drove out here from independence for my lunch today .  i wanted to get my usual mainstay of adobo and unfortunately they did not have it .  i advise to peruse the online menu and try to order ahead .  i went with the special for the day which was the bistec .  it was a tender serving of beef and onion served atop a bed of white rice .  a few filipina women came in while i was there and all ordered the same .  i also had the shanghai rolls and bbq pork skewers .  everything was delicious .    what really won my heart over was the star of the show; mely .  we had a great conversation about life and our experiences as human beings .  she is extremely busy because of the business and often caters to local hospitals .  her birthday is coming up in august and i am definitely stopping up to eat and celebrate .  i hope that she does not retire any time soon because i want to eat some more of the wonderful food she cooks .  i highly recommend mely ' s kainan for some great filipino food . 
__label__5 first time eating filipino cuisine .  it was great .  a lot of big flavor and interesting choices .  the older woman who works here was a total sweetheart .  if you in the mood to try something new this is a good place to start . 
__label__4 this place has some really nice zza .   i have only had pizza by the slice ,  and every time it was spot on .   this is one of the few where i will actually eat the crust .      this place also has super friendly service .  determinately a mom and pop feel .   the owner was super friendly and he let me know that the sauce and dough is made from scratch . 
__label__5 damn it  .  .  was too good to be true that this place would re-open  .  .  sign said "closed due to vandalism  .  .  re-open asap"  .  .  yet it appears that will not happen  .  .  that sucks  .  .  was a great alternative to chain pizza in the area
__label__5 "i was looking for an outlet and andrea came into my life at just the right moment .   her voice continues to lift me and her words encourage me . " - judi mao ,  san francisco ,  ca  above was my testimony back in 2012 .  today in 2015 andrea still has an impact on me and i still hear her voice .  the lessons i ' ve learn still continues today .  i ' ve made so much improvements in areas of my finances that i will be debt free this year .  having a coach for the 1 1 / 2 year i ' ve worked with her has helped me tremendously !  i was able to travel on a budget and had success in my career .  i look forward to working with her again .  if you ' re looking for a coach ,  she ' s pretty intuitive and great .  you will have a complimentary consult !  so give her a call ! 
__label__4 this was my first but certainly not last visit here .   i like gfs for some things ,  but for equipment ,  deans is the best .   i needed bakery boxes  ( like the kind i save from the grocery store when i get a little desert for a treat )  so i can hand out my homemade cookies and not have to worry about getting the container back .     it is like disney land for cooks and i can ' t wait to go back .  ! 
__label__5 today was our first visit and chances are we ' ll be back ,  our time was limited yet we still left with several neat items .    great deal on diner style coffee mugs .  .  . made in the usa  ,  awesome colors for  . 99-1 . 49 ( yay )  .  also  ,  neat items for cocktails .  can ' t wait to go back and roam the aisles
__label__4 surprising there are not more reviews and only one local for dean ' s .  guess most yelpers prefer eating out to cooking .  my first passion is cooking and happy that after so many years i found dean ' s .  as one reviewer stated much better to buy chef-ware than celebrity-ware .    i walk up and down every aisle and find it impossible to not find some kitchen tool or gadget i need ,  want ,  or did not know existed .  the things you see hanging on peg boards at tjmaxx or target are all here at much lower prices .  there are not only huge cans of condiments but also a few smaller sized jars of things such as artichoke hearts .    i have friends over for dinner frequently .  i always cook so much that i send them home using plastic containers i buy at the grocery store .  i bought 100 restaurant carry out lidded large containers for some low price .  now my friends leave looking like they just left some deli .  seti ' s food truck is located in the parking lot making the trip even more worthwhile . 
__label__5 this place has the most unexpected inventory .  you can find some super good deals among all the unexpected items .  i go here regularly to see the new stuff .  i feel like maybe the inventory comes from a freight liquidator because this stuff is so mixed up .  it ' s seriously an adventure every time i go .  great employees too ! 
__label__2 love michael symon .  .  .  but the burgers here are not worth the $$$ .   two cheeseburgers ,  one order of lola fries ,  and two soft drinks in a very casual  ( loud )  dining room were just under $40 .   our burgers were good ,  not great; both were ordered medium and both were served overdone .     one would think as well when you pay this much for burgers and fries ,  you would get your beverage in a glass .  .  .  with a refill or two .   we got plastic cups of ice with a little soda drizzled over the cubes .     dine here if you ' re at the casino and there are no other options .   if there are other options ,  go elsewhere .   life ' s too short to be disappointed by your burgers and fries . 
__label__2 i go here all the time despite my two stars because it ' s cheaper than starbucks next door and the coffee is better .   it seems like the drive-through always takes forever .   maybe everyone is ordering complicated sandwiches ,  but if mcdonalds can do it fast ,  why can ' t dunkin donuts ?   i ' ve had my order messed up a few times ,  my credit card dropped on the ground by the window cashier ,  etc .   also ,  when you order they never tell you your total ,  they just say thank you .   can ' t you tell me my total so i know you got everything ?   the height of my disappointment came last week when i went inside ,  thinking it would be faster .   one person in front of me but i waited at least 6-7 minutes because she was some clueless person who had to decide on each donut in her dozen individually ,  with much thought .   then she wanted a drink and wanted to know her options and prices because she apparently couldn ' t read the menu .   that itself is not the store ' s fault ,  but there were at least 6 people working .   one of them could have come over to ring me up ,  but it took that long for them to realize i ' d been waiting forever .   if you ' re in any kind of hurry ,  don ' t come here . 
__label__5 had it not been for et ,  shatangi would not exist .  parents met here .  whoa !  !  !  i love to have a beer here whenever in town and listen to the latest craze in up-and-coming music from it ' s origin .   shatangi told you
__label__5 i ' m a 25 year old athletic female that used to live in nyc .  i practiced both vinyasa and bikram religiously while living in the city .   however ,  when i moved to cleveland for graduate school my options were limited .   personally ,  i ' m not a fan of cleveland yoga in beachwood due to the lack of yoga knowledge .   whenever i would attend a class at cleveland yoga ,  i felt like it was a lululemon housewife contest with roaring chatter before each class .   and when the classes began i felt like i was being yelled at for an hour .   not my idea of yoga or a spiritual experience .    so i found myself at bikram yoga cleveland and instantly i was in love .   the instructors are fantastic -- extremely knowledgeable and warm .   they truly appreciate the spirituality aspect of yoga .   the facility was impeccable ,  especially the yoga room and locker room .   i ' m relieved to see more options here in cleveland .   i will definitely return ! 
__label__4 i love this place .   i work nearby and i eat here several times a week ,  every week .   the value here is incredible .   the regular price for two tacos is only $3 . 50 !   that would be a good price anywhere but for downtown ,  it ' s a great price .   on taco tuesday you get three tacos for $3 . 50 !   we ' re talking about freshly grilled vegetables and grilled chicken breast - real meat ,  not fast-food reconstituted meat product ,  but real meat - and a full array of available toppings .   the tacos are delicious ,  soft or hard ,  especially with the spicy-tangy "chipotle" sauce .   i don ' t order rice or beans so i can ' t comment on those but the meat and vegetables are consistently good .   the vegetables ,  tomatoes ,  and lettuce are always fresh ,  in fact all the ingredients  ( that don ' t come from a can )  are .   i don ' t think they do pick-up but the regular service is fast ,  i usually only wait a couple minutes in line before my turn .   i have only a few tiny nitpicks ,   ( 1 )  not all of the employees are overly friendly  ( though some of the girls are awesome )  ,   ( 2 )  the corn tastes like it came out of a can ,  and  ( 3 )  if they ' re not careful straining the tomatoes ,  you end up with tomato juices inside the taco and it can get soggy and can fall apart .   all told ,  though ,  these are minor complaints for a place that delivers great food at an extremely reasonable price .   this is my favorite places to eat lunch downtown in the theater district . 
__label__1 what a poor imitation of chipotle or qdoba .  watery rice .  chips soggy with oil .  bad service .  stale tortillas .  and they wrap the burrito into a ball . 
__label__1 i know this is primarily a salon ,  however i went for their nail service on my lunch break a few weeks ago .  the stylist and salon aspect looked great but the nail service was terrible .  personally ,  painting my nails is one of my hobbies ,  so when i go to get my nails done ,  and pay $23 for it ,  i expect the best quality service .    the nail trimming was weak ,  the hand massage lasted less than 5 minutes ,  although i ' m glad it did because she was just wiggling my hand ,  and to top it off she got nail polish all over my skin and didn ' t remove it .  needless to say i could have done a way better job and unfortunately this experience has turned me away from ever paying to get my nails done again . 
__label__2 good salon once i get in but every time i go they make me wait for 20 to 40 minutes to see me .  this is with even having an appointment .  its obnoxious but there aren ' t good competitors downtown to give me any bargaining power .  crazy mullets- take a hint ?  ? 
__label__5 as a girl with naturally curly locks ,  i can not trust my hair in the hands of just anyone .   i ' ve been to several salons in the cleveland area that left me patiently praying for hair growth .   luckily ,  dino palmieri is not one of them .   i totally lucked out ,  really ,  because i can walk there .   i have had several stylists there cut and color my hair and i have never left disappointed .   they have a talented staff and the prices are reasonable .   i can tell them i want a long ,  curly style and they get it right .  conversely ,  if i want a short ,  straight bob they get that right ,  as well - which is not an easy task when a person has been called "frizz-ball" or variations thereof more times than one can recount ! 
__label__4 chris does such a great job on men ' s cuts and kids '  cuts .   he is engaging and friendly .   i love how he finishes a men ' s cut with another rinse at the bowl .   he is a consummate professional .   just beware:  he has a tendency to cut hair too short even if you just want a trim .   yes you will pay more than average for a haircut with him but you can tell it is a great haircut a mile away . 
__label__5 there seems to be a little chinese takeout place on every corner of cleveland .  they range from ok to pretty good .  most have a very similar approach and food; many even seem to use the same menu and menu board with just the restaurant name changed .  at first glance richie chan ' s at cedar lee  ( 13181 cedar rd )  in cleveland heights ,  may fit in with all the rest ,  but a closer look will reveal something completely different .  this is not your average chinese takeout place .    walking in to richie chan ' s there are 3 tables out front ,  using the goldilocks approach ,  1 small ,  1 medium and 1 large .  the difference from most takeout places is that you will frequently find these tables filled .  that ' s right ,  this is not just takeout .  an especially good sign is the frequently the customers are asian .  the decor is not much ,  some old chinese prints right out of most older chinese restaurants ,  hang high on the walls .  the floor is covered with industrial runner carpets ,  but they try to make the place feel homey and while a bit run down it is clean .    when you look at the menu you will notice that richie chan ' s has its own menu .  all of the standards are there chow mein ,  egg foo young ,  lo mein ,  fried rice and combination plates; these are all done very well .   you will notice other options ,  including some very good noodle dishes ,  fish dishes and others you won ' t see at most takeouts .  then in addition to the menu there are additional items that are posted in chinese ,  you can ask for an explanation ,  but the best option is to watch the other tables and ask what they have .    the food that comes out is generally very good to excellent .  among my favorites is the shrimp lo mein ,  the singapore chow mei funn and the shrimp chow mein cantonese style .  let me talk about the last cantonese chow mein .  at richie chan ' s you get a large serving of fresh fried noodles  ( think similar to pan fried noodles ,  but with bigger noodles )  with good sized shrimp and baby bok choy in a delicious white sauce .  overall food quality and taste is excellent .  in addition there are a number of items that are definitely not take out style .  there are several fish dishes and i have tried the salty peppery shrimp special which is excellent .  the shrimp are fried in a very light batter which has a real peppery kick .  the large portion of delicious shrimp are served over a bed of lettuce and topped with slices of very small ,  very hot green and red peppers .  a spicy ,  slightly sweet red dipping sauce is served on the side .  wonderful ,  especially if you want something that will wake up your tongue with a lot of heat .    service is an interesting point ,  depending on what you order ,  you may be served in styrofoam or on traditional plates .  that ' s right a "takeout place" that serves on regular plates .  also you will usually get a choice of hot or cold tea and a little plate of fruit .    at lunch you can choose from the very tasty combinations that are reasonably priced and they are one of the best values in town .  to summarize the experience ,  the decor and setting is takeout ,  but the food and the friendly family approach is a winner .  this is not the place to take someone to impress them ,  but if you want very good chinese food at a reasonable price ,  this is the place to go .  a definite winner and worth trying ,  even if just getting an order to go on your way home from downtown . 
__label__4 got the vegetable lo mein and hunan tofu .  food was prepared very fast .  there was a lot of it and overall was good quality .  we got a complimentary orange .    was it the best chinese food i ' ve ever had ?  no .  but it is far better than many other chinese places i ' ve eaten at and the quality:money ratio is very good .  would i go back ?  definitely . 
__label__1 one word describes this location:  slow !  !  !   i really like white castle ,  and i know that the food is made fresh and takes longer than most fast food restaurants ,  but 25 minutes in a drive through with no one in front of you .   really ? 
__label__1 very poor customer service !  i took in a few ladies cotton shirts be laundered and lightly starched .  i like my white cotton shirts to look fresh and crisp .  two girls at the counter both said that ladies shirts cannot be laundered ,  only dry cleaned .  only men ' s shirts can be laundered .  that makes no sense !  i said that i would take them somewhere else to be laundered .  the girls said "everyone else has the same equipment they won ' t be able to launder them either . " i went directly across the street to do summers and asked if i could have the shirts laundered and they said "of course . " is al fran cleaners under new management or why are they so clueless ? 
__label__1 as an update to my previous review ,  finally after a month of back and forth with my jacket ,  i got it back ,  and am very pleased that the owner took additional measures to get the blue stains out ,  which i would expect given that they were made while in his company ' s possession .  lisa ,  the manager ,  was incredibly helpful during this process .  i asked for a refund on my original cleaning fee since i had to go through a month-long ordeal to get my jacket cleaned ,  so she did give me a refund .  that being said ,  i will never return .  this experience was awful and unacceptable from a dry cleaner . 
__label__5 homemade chipotle basically .  really good except they only have shredded chicken .   i got a bowl and it was really huge .  friendly staff .  good guacamole . 
__label__5 this is why i love local joints .  jeff and michelle and their crew began making themselves double-shelled tacos with a soft flour ,  pasted with refried beans ,  wrapped around a hard taco ,  then filled with normal taco things .  they loved them so much that they said ,  "hey .  .  . why not put this on the menu ? "  and that ' s how the 25th street taco was born .  it ' s my favorite food item in the world . 
__label__5 where do i even begin ?  how can one even begin to write a review to properly articulate how incredible ,  flavorful ,  and goddamn sexy ohio city burrito is ?    i ' ve been here a few times and i have yet to be let down .    service is fast and friendly .  your order is made in front of you like at a chipotle .  there are various vegetarian  (  )  and omnivore options .  get the steak .  just get it .  it ' s spicy ,  tender ,  flavorful ,  and delicious .  there are a ton of salsa options and multiple tasty add ons .    chips and salsa are always great ,  and the guac packs a punch .    highly recommend if you ' re in ohio city and want to devour something simply perfect . 
__label__4 i ' ve been to ohio city burrito a few times , i have enjoyed every item i ' ve ordered . it beats chipotle and cordobo any day . prices are very good and portions are huge . i seldom finish a burrito in one sitting . 
__label__4 ocb was a nice stop on a recent tour of the ohio city / west side market bar district .  although they ' d hate the comparison ,  the selections and ordering system are similar to chipotle in terms of build-your-own burritos and bowls  ( "naked burritos , "in ocb-speak )  .   although the selection of ingredients is a little smaller than some of the chains ,  quality trumps quantity here ,  particularly in the salsa dept .  among the several selections ,  the habanero hot offering was fresh and truly fiery ,  appreciably better than anything i ' ve had at a chain--worth a visit just for that .  ocb is uber cheap ,  and  ( unlike giant corporate chain whose name we shall not repeat )  allows you to add guac for free .    actually ,  if we ' re ranking ocb alongside refgional / national chains ,  here ' s what i ' d say: slightly better than chipotle; appreciably better than qdoba or baja fresh; vastly better than moe ' s or freebirds .  in fact ,  why are you eating at any of those places rather than supporting a scrappy local underdog ?  and why were you eating at moe ' s or freebirds at all ?   the dining room is decorated in dia de los muertos kitsch and available-for-purchase business swag .  it looks cool and fun ,  and represents a well-thought approach to the market niche .  the staff was nice and informative .  i like ohio city burrito and you should stop in to buffer yourself against the slew of craft brews you ' ll want afterword in the ohio city brewpubs . 
__label__3 got a veggie burrito .  i liked that the refried beans were vegetarian ,  but the rest of the ingredients were kind of boring .  chipotle has better guacamole by far and ocb is pretty stingy with the sour cream .  not a bad place to grab lunch if you ' re in the area ,  but i wouldn ' t go out of my way to eat here . 
__label__3 pretty good burritos and the ingredients seem fresh .  not amazing but definitely worth it ' s price so you really can ' t go wrong .  plus i hear it ' s locally owned and even though i travel a bit i still like to keep money in the communities rather than making chipotle and qudoba richer . 
__label__4 food was delicious but the staff wasn ' t very friendly .   it was my first time and i ' ll definitely go back again because of the food- but they should really be more patient with helping someone who has never been there . 
__label__4 this is a great place for a quick lunch .  i would say it ' s well above chipolte ,  but just below a nice ,  sit-down mexican restaurant .   the restaurant itself has a fun atmosphere to it ,  the employees were really nice and easy to engage with .  the decor is hip and kinda artsy .  there ' s a bulletine board to post your crappy band ' s flier at or an event posting about the annual lunar meeting of kindred spirit chakra swap .   i ordered the taco salad and was pleased with what i got for the price i paid .  there ' s options for beans and salsa ,  so you can get it hotter ,  more tame ,  black beans or refried .  make it your own !  if it isn ' t hot enough ,  you can grab the bottle of hot sauce that is conviently located by the napkins and utensils . 
__label__4 best bagels in cleveland with an awesome variety of cream cheese .   coffee is just average and there is room for improvement in that department . 
__label__3 best bagel in cleveland for sure but the price point is waaaaaaay off and the bagels are really small .  a bagel with cream cheese is $4 . 00 !  i am from the ny area originally and in mid town manhattan the most expensive bagel w /  cc was $3 . 05 at essa bagel or $1 . 25 plain .  in manhattan .  the website says their goal is to make a food that 99% can afford but if a dozen bagels sets you back over $20 . 00 i think you missed that boat . 
__label__5 i ' m hooked on these ,  leathery on the outside chewy on the inside  .  .  .  delicious .  i wish they had their own outlet but you find them at a couple coffee shops and restaurants ,  i got my first taste at risingstar coffee and it was a good experience
__label__3 my friend raves about this place so i decided to stop by .  i got the sea salt bagel with horse radish spread and a couple of coffee  the bagel could have been better but i think that ' s because it was cold .  i should have asked for it toasted  ( my mistake )  .  the horseradish spread was great and not too radishy !   i was expecting to be blow away ,  which i wasn ' t .  but i definitely come back to try the other bagels and spreads .  i think the pricepoint is weird: the spreads cost $2 ,  which is also the cost of a bagel !  that being said ,  it ' s definitely better than anything i have tried in cleveland .   tip: whatever you do ,  don ' t get coffee there .  i had to trash it . 
__label__4 hey ,  these bagels are really good !   after living in nyc for a number of years ,  my bagel addiction has felt unquenched living on cleveland ' s west side .   cle bagel co had a handful of solid flavors when i stopped in on a monday mid-morning-- i grabbed a half dozen and a tube of schmear for the road .    ( although i was really just concerned about the everything bagel which is my number one fave .  )   the bagels were hot ,  malty .  .  .  perfect amount of chew and crunch ratio-- no complaints there !   i tried the cheddar and chive spread which the lady at the counter said was the most popular .   overall ,  a little expensive but i appreciate what they are doing over there and i will definitely be back when i need my bagel fix . 
__label__3 i think it ' s cool they make the bagels fresh .  but  they really didn ' t taste very different than einsteins bagels to me .  i was also suprised they don ' t have a commercial bagel slicer .  i bought a half dozen and wanted them sliced but there was a line behind me and they had one little bagel slicer .  i didn ' t want to hold up the line .  also they seemed a little disorganized in their service .  not rude ,  just sort of frazzled by the crowd . 
__label__5 i have a constant battle with the wish of having a location near lakewood / rocky river so i could go here on my way to work but then i come back to reality and think how much weight i would gain and how much money i would spend if this were on my way to work .  i can ' t seem to get enough of these bagels !  i crave them all the time .  bagels are one of my all time favorite foods and if you have ever had a fresh just made bagel from here they might end up being your favorite food too !   to me the different cream cheeses are an added bonus .  i love cream cheese don ' t get me wrong but the bagels sell themselves and i love using them to make sandwiches for breakfast or for lunch .  the cheddar chive is one of my favorites and it might be because i have never had the bacon fig .  .  .  i have a feeling that one could be my favorite .    thank you cleveland bagel co for bringing bagels to the west side !  i am forever grateful . 
__label__2 extremely disappointing visit: $7= 1 bagel + schmear on the bagel + oj  ( less than 8oz )  + $1 tip = too expensive taste: average for a bagel ,  schemear: was not life changing ,  didn ' t taste the brie ,  honey or walnut .  experience: average .  wish them the best of luck . 
__label__5 the donuts here were amazing .   this is the donut shop formerly known as presti ' s .   i won ' t explain in detail just how good they are because it would just be mean since they are now closed .   i just drove by and called them .   there is no more gillys .   sniff .  .  . 
__label__5 the cream filled donuts ,  with real whipped filling ,  are amazing .  i had heard of this place before i even moved to cleveland ,  and it definitely lives up to its reputation .  the only downside is that it doesn ' t take credit cards ,  so make sure you have cash on hand  ( we had to walk all over little italy looking for an atm just to get our donut fix )  .  but these are definitely some of the best ! 
__label__2 they have a sign with a glowing endorsement from mario batali in the front window .  "best cassata cake outside of italy" however ,  they could neither confirm nor deny whether mario was wearing his orange crocs when he visited .  this makes me doubt the credibility ,  when i ate it .  .  .  i knew it was a lie .  it was just a cake ,  nothing special . 
__label__5 one of my favorite places to patronize when i ' m home .   i ' ve yet to find a better cannoli .   the chocolate dipped cannoli are amazing .   great cassata cake too although i still prefer fragapane ' s in bay village . 
__label__5 corbo ' s had me before i even walked in .  case in point: a sign on the door that reads  ' leave the gun ,  take the cannoli .  '   ( as a disclaimer ,  this is not a political statement about gun laws ,  this is a quote from the godfather )  .   cases upon cases upon cases of doughnuts ,  cassata cake ,  biscotti  ( my favorite )  ,  cannoli and more will greet you when you enter .  don ' t be scared to ask the girls behind the counter questions .  they ' ll give you great suggestions !  corbo ' s is basically a cleveland institution and you can ' t go wrong with any order .  i love that not only does the bakery have readily available items in the cases ,  but a freezer full of gelato and other frozen treats ,  a wall of $3 "odds and ends" boxes of biscotti and cookies  ( such a deal )  ,  and other to-go cakes boxed and ready to go .  the "odds and ends" are literally just as good as anything else deemed as perfect .   we all know parking in little italy can be tough .  should you be in the neighborhood and happen to find a spot ,  just take it .  go in and get something even if you don ' t need it !  store it in the fridge and eat it later .  for me ,  the must tries at corbo ' s are the freshly stuffed cannoli and the cassata cake .  definitely leave the gun and take the cannoli . 
__label__4 stopped in during the feast of the assumption after picking up a few bowls of handmade cavatelli at their stand outside the bakery .     the bakery smells like a dream--namely ,  a fragrant ,  vanilla-scented ,  ice-cream-y dream .   they sport a dazzling array of cookies and cakes ,  of which we sampled their tiramisu and cannolis .   the tiramisu was hands down the best i ' ve ever had: the filling was rich but fluffy and infused with an intense mocha flavor ,  paired with a crumbly chocolatey bottom layer .   good thing i don ' t live near little italy .  .  . i ' d have it every day if i could .   the cannolis were pretty good but the filling ,  which is embedded with chocolate chips ,  had an odd ,  custard-like--super smooth yet dense-lumpy texture .    colozza ' s in parma still has the lead in the cannoli category ,  at least for me .   i ' m not sure if they carry this all the time ,  but their cavatelli was excellent ,  with the creamy-al-dente texture of fresh pasta and stick-to-you-ribs heaviness that ' s characteristic of italian comfort staples .   the only drawback: our cavatelli bowls each came with an enormous meatball ,  just a tad smaller than a baseball ,  and while the flavor was good ,  the texture was disappointing .   60% of it must have been comprised of some odd filler that resembled bits of wet paper .   in short: corbo ' s makes killer tiramisu and cavatelli  ( pasta only )  .   they ' ll definitely be on the top of my list when i ' m looking for a cassata cake or any cake ,  really . 
__label__2 was not too impressed with corbo ' s .  try presti ' s instead !  presti ' s has much better variety of pastries and foods ,  as well as gelato .  one thing corbo ' s does have is italian ice though . 
__label__3 mah ,  do not like the new location .  it really lost a lot of charm .  cannolis still great though . 
__label__5 i have now used cleveland photo group for 3 professional photo shoots  (  1 even predated the groups conversion to digital format )  .  the service and image results have been top notch each and every time .  i have had 2 friends use the groups services for their weddings and both photo albums have been stunning .  i will continue to keep the cleveland photo group in my wheelhouse of photography service providers as new projects emerge . 
__label__1 so sad .  the taco salad was a watery bunch of wilted iceberg lettuce topped with a huge pile of cooked onions ,  a smattering of black beans straight from a can ,  small  gobs of guac ,  sour cream and a tad of cheese .   i literally threw it in the garbage and drove over to wendy ' s  .   not good ,  guys . 
__label__3 used to like this place when i lived in cleveland .  in town from san francisco and completely bummed at the sloppy burrito to go
__label__4 what a great burrito !   love that fried beans are an options .   pork was tender and flavorful . 
__label__1 ohio city burrito looks like a cool little indie burrito spot ,  but the food is horrible !  don ' t waste your time here .  the quality of the food is poor and is much closer to taco bell than chipotle . 
__label__5 it is like going to eat at grandma ' s .   comfort food at a great price .  so far everything we had there has been excellent .  staff is friendly and food comes out pretty quick .  expect a working man ' s restaurant ,   no frills . 
__label__4 good food at a nice place .  it ' s an older diner ,  breakfast all day kind of place .  the burger was fantastic ,  the fries are frozen ,  not fresh ,  and the burger comes with soup as well .  the soup is not homemade ,  but it was good .  overall it was a very good lunch .  great service ,  and it is inexpensive .  the coffee was excellent as well .  i ' d go back any day ,  it was enjoyable . 
__label__4 how is there not a listing already for 668 ?  ?  i ' ve lived here for almost a year and a half now and absolutely love it .  i literally fell in love with this building just by looking at pictures and their website online .  once i visited ,  i knew this was the apartment for me .  it ' s in the heart of downtown cleveland - and convenient to some pretty amazing things .  there are so many bars and restaurants within walking distance .  east 4th street is right around the corner .  warehouse district is across public square and a brief walk  ( or a short cab ride late at night when you may not feel the safest walking alone )  .  horseshoe casino is 2 blocks away .  progressive field and quicken loans arena are literally in your backyard and brown ' s stadium is maybe 6 blocks away .    i promise .  .  .  i don ' t work for 668 or k&d .  .  .  i just live here and love it !  can you tell ?  ?  anyways ,  the things that attracted me to the building were of course the location .  .  .  the fact that it had granite countertops and stainless steel appliances ,  and the fact that there was a washer and dryer in each unit .    if you work at cleveland clinic ,  they ' re a preferred employer so you get a 2 . 5% discount on each months rent and a decreased security deposit ,  which is super nice .  i ' m sure there are more - i think uh is too but i just know about ccf since i work there .    there is 24 hour security on site ,  which makes me feel pretty safe  ( with the exceptions of the times the security guards are just smoking outside or watching tv in the leasing office )  but for the most part ,  they are sitting at the desk and are looking out for ya !  george is definitely my favorite !  he is so friendly ,  helpful  ( will grab doors for you when you clearly have a lot in your hands )  and will make conversation and actually want to hear about your day !  !    the property manager ,  jill ,  is awesome .  so hilarious and super friendly .  any time i ' ve had an issue ,  i ' ve gone to her and she ' s made sure it has been fixed very promptly .  maintenance people are wonderful too .  if you put in an issue ,  it ' s  ( usually )  resolved within a day .  i did have an issue with my blinds that went on for months but when they realized it wasn ' t followed up on ,  they made sure they fixed it right away .    within the building ,  there ' s titan ' s gym - a full-size gym that is 24 hours and has outside members as well .  the first year of residence ,  you get free membership then you pay monthly starting your second year .  i ' d say that ' s a great deal !  hodges is right downstairs  ( which is ok .  .  but i love their patio )  .  and ,  across from titans on the prospect side is stonetown  ( used to be nexus cafe )  .    the only thing i ' d change about this place would be my floor plan .  there ' s only one set of big windows to the outside that i can ' t even open in my living room .  it ' s usually not an issue ,  except the ventilation isn ' t the best .  but ,  summers definitely allow for low air conditioning bills since the sun isn ' t beaming into the whole apartment and spreading heat !    overall ,  i love this place .  they usually have a huge wait list ,  so be sure to get on it asap if you are even remotely thinking about living here . 
__label__5 i needed to order a sympathy floral arrangement after the sudden passing of a beloved coworker and decided to try out lyndhurst florist .  i called to place my order and the person i spoke with was super helpful and promised to make a special custom arrangement for this sad occasion .  i was blown away when i got to the funeral home .  the planter that was made up had lovely fall colors and was a combination of a live plant and fresh cut flowers .  i had multiple coworkers approach me after the calling hours to tell me how nice the planter looked .   i couldn ' t be more pleased .  i will definitely order flowers from lyndhurst florist again . 
__label__4 i love the sandwiches they make here !  they are fresh ,  big and sooo good !  the italian is my favorite which comes with all kinds of good meats !  i don ' t have one of these in chicago by me so when i come home i ' m sure to stop in here !  i think it ' s better than subway or quizno ' s . 
__label__3 i had my first cannoli at corbo ' s in little italy !   it was a messy good time .   now i know what all the hype is about .   delizioso ! 
__label__4 i was visiting cleveland for the weekend ,  and my hosts took me to little italy for dinner .  being sicilian ,  i was loving this .  after dinner ,  one of my hosts wanted lemon ice and wandered into corbo ' s .  i was ecstatic to discover that corbo ' s had italian sesame cookies !  sesame cookies were a staple of my childhood .  .  . and something i haven ' t had in at least 20 years .  they are not made en masse like they used to be ,  and there is no italian bakery in raleigh  ( something that should really be rectified ,  but i digress )  ,  so i was so happy to see this .  i had to buy half a dozen cookies .  and they were just like i remembered them--dry and crumbly ,  with just a hint of extra flavor .   ( i always taste lemon ,  but i ' m told it ' s actually anise .  )  i was a happy camper .    thank you ,  corbo ' s ,  for returning me briefly to my childhood .  : )  my cleveland hosts are coming to raleigh in a couple of weeks and have promised to bring me more sesame cookies from corbo ' s .  .  . i hope they do ! 
__label__5 hands down the best italian bakery in the area !   i ordered a cassata cake via phone for my boyfriend ' s birthday and it was the most amazing cake i ' ve had in a while .  cleveland is famous for it ' s cassata cake and this is the place to go .  the waitress was very friendly and helpful on the phone - she helped me decide the stuffings ,  the size ,  and the toppings and everything .  they also accept credit card via phone or payment at pick up . 
__label__2 the good:  low prices .  fast and friendly service ,  even on a crowded sunday late morning .  seems well-run .  clearly popular--i ' ve been a few times ,  and there are always a lot of people .    the bad:  fairly small menu .   ( i think they are only open for breakfast and lunch ,  and their breakfast menu is surprisingly short .  )  not much atmosphere .  pancakes are fluffy and good ,  but way too big to eat  ( one is a meal ,  but two is the smallest order )  and served with plain non-maple syrup that isn ' t nearly as good as the pancakes deserve .  scrambled eggs came mixed with globs of brown meat grease  ( or something like that ) --very unappetizing .   the meat-eaters in my party agreed with me: it ' s ok ,  but not good enough to draw us back again .  if my friends wanted to go there ,  i wouldn ' t refuse .  tip: there is parking in back off of green . 
__label__1 this place is a joke without danny at the bar .   clientelle are whiny and suck unless they are controlled .   if she isnt there ,  no other barmaids can handle anything abd would prefer to just kick people out . 
__label__5 hidden gem !  !  definitely a dive bar ,  but that ' s never a bad thing !  everyone was very welcoming from the moment my boyfriend and i walked through the door .  the atmosphere was so lively ,  i loved it .  we decided to check out the patio area since it was a nice day .  we were seated right away and the manager even came to greet us .  i ' m sure she had an inkling that it was our first time there so she went ahead and bought us a round of drinks on the house ,  which was super nice of her .   happy hour runs m-f 3p-7p and sat 11a-5p ,  and i think all day sunday ,  but don ' t quote me on that as i ' m not sure .  we got there just in time for happy hour and found that their wings are only 45 cents everyday after 5p and all day sunday !  i guess i know where i ' ll be spending sunday funday .  we ordered some wings ,  hot buffalo garlic ,  garlic parmesan ,  and caribbean jerk .  finger licking good .  the wings were actually a decent size and the flavors were just right .  we also ordered quesadillas and some waffle fries with cheese .  so yummy and good portions !  we decided to stick to bottled beers and the prices were very cheap ,  another plus .   service was awesome !  everyone was quite attentive and checked on us regularly ,  not just our server .  they ' ve got an a in my book for service that ' s for sure .  after we were done eating ,  it did get a bit chilly and noticed that the outdoor fans were on .  one of the employees was nice enough to turn them off when i mentioned i was getting bit cold .   i can ' t wait to come back here for more wings .  we spoke to another customer and he suggested trying their burgers so i may just have to do that during my next visit . 
__label__4 i like coming here for a good burger & beer & it ' s a nice place to bring my kids & family to eat .  it ' s a cozy little bar & grill & just recently added a nice outdoor patio . 
__label__5 the staff is friendly and the owner is just fantastic !  great service !  this is a great local corner bar !  even the regulars are super friendly !   food is wonderful and their wings are the best !  they have a covered outdoor patio with heaters .  it is more like a 3 season patio .    and the best part ,  for me ,  is that there is designated motorcycle parking ! 
__label__1 the new directv now service sounds great .  too bad it ' s the worst streaming service ever !  top the horrible streaming service with even worse customer service that is busy blaming you for their problems .  the only thing that streams on my pc are the commercials .  if you love commercials and don ' t want to watch more than 50% of the actual show that you are paying for then this is the service for you .  virtually any other streaming service is better .  do not give them your credit card # because once they have your money they are done with you .  they have not offered any actual help for me and they have flat out refused to offer me a refund .  also ,  i paid $60 . 00 for a month but only got 27 days for that month ' s fee .  read the reviews before you buy .  there are literally no good comments about this from the suckers .  .  . er .  . customers . 
__label__1 worst cable service ever .   the picture is always in and out ,  or pausing ,  or blurry .   the only thing worse is there customer service .   and it didn ' t get any better under at&t .   they are rude pieces of shit !   my contract is over in a month and i will not allow renew .   i will also have them removed from all of my rental properties .   assholes
__label__4 attended the yelp event here ,  but many of my friends have been raving about this plave since it opened .   loved the samples of beer  ( and i am not a beer drinker )  paired with the food ,  as well as the cool vibe of the place .   also ,  the food we tried was fantastic .     i ordered off the menu from the event to try some different drinks and each was made well ,  strong ,  and the bartenders were very friendly !     since i work very close ,  this will absolutely be a place we frequent again !   thanks again ,  yelp ,  for having us experience something new ! 
__label__5 the pizza was delicious !  loved the crust & sweet sauce .  we also got the bbq wings which were really really good ,  especially since we ' re from buffalo & we are tough wing critics ! 
__label__5 the pizza was awesome !   the service was timely and the owner of this particular spot is really cool .   he made me some very hot ,  hot wings !   he ' s always been friendly and has a great memory .   this is a spot that we frequent over and over again ! 
__label__5 super amazing joint great service best people the couple who runs this place is sooooo sweet we got the honey mustard chicken wings ,  steak and cheese sub ,  bbq chicken sub and chicken parm sub ,  everything was super delicious and definitely recommend !  !  ! 
__label__4 great pizza ,  went in to try something new .  when i walked in two police officers were sitting in the cozy seating area enjoying a pie .  to me this said ,  "yeah this is good food" lol .  anyhoo ,  got a great pizza in under twenty minutes ,   almost as though i made at home myself .  prices a little steep but its worth it .  try  ' em out ! 
__label__5 i ' ve been eating year for years and the owner is always so sweet and even after my living the state for years then coming back he still remembers .  awesome experience and flipping yummy pizza ! 
__label__5 i love presti ' s .  my favorite spot in little italy .  everything is always fresh ,  the service is fast and the workers are very friendly ! 
__label__5 presti ' s did not disappoint me .   they have always had a great reputation for fine italian pastries and other bakery items such as fresh bread .   well ,  i write this to tell all ,  that the reputations continues .   the brownies ,  homemade cookies and of course ,  the canoli ' s were some of the best i have ever had .   when ever i am visiting cleveland ,  i try to make a visit to presti ' s bakery . 
__label__5 brennan ' s is a typical pub grub kind of place except for one thing .  .  .  .   the burgers .  .  .  the "all-world" is out of this world .  .  .  but any of their burgers was good .  .  .   as scott g .  says it has a wide variety of customers .  .  .  and it is surprisingly kid friendly .  .  . 
__label__4 a solid pub with surprisingly good grub .  nice selection of beers on draft .  this place takes on several different guises depending on the time of day you visit .  at lunch ,  it ' s tradesmen having a beer with their meal .  early evening  ( full dinner service starts at 5:30 )  ,  the place is a kid-friendly hangout for beleaguered parents  ( a bit like a traditional irish pub in that sense -- mixed ages w / something for everyone )  .  a bit later ,  more couples and groups having dinner ,  drinks or both .   there is now a very nice patio with its own bar out back .   last time i dropped in the service at the bar was pretty disinterested ,  but i ' m hoping that was a fluke . 
__label__4 a great local cleveland hts .  bar that has been apart of lee rd for over 20 years .  they have the best patio of all the bars on lee rd !  great wings but prices are on the expensive side  ( food and drink )  compared to similar bars down the street .  definitely a must stop on the lee rd bar crawl . 
__label__4 service has always been great and the meatballs are absolutely amazing .  the only flaw i can think of is that the sauce is a little watery .  but other than that i think its a great adition to shaker square
__label__4 came for the special mother ' s day brunch buffet created by chef fabio salerno and what an experience !   would ' ve been a five-star ,  but a star off for the sort of awkward ,  almost absent-minded demeanor of the service .   but aside from that ,  it was almost too good to be true .   pricing wasn ' t unreasonable ,  totaling $150 for 3 adults ,  3 drinks  ( $8 mimosas and bloody marys )  ,  including 20% tip and 10% yelp check-in discount  ( hooray !  )  .   more lunch than breakfast ,  this buffet featured some of the best quality food--especially seafood and meat--i have come across in any restaurant ,  buffet-style or not .   enormous bluepoint oysters on the half ,  succulent ,  perfectly-done prime rib carved in 1-inch slabs ,  juicy ,  thick-bodied shrimp cocktail served with a spicy cocktail sauce ,  a crepe station where crepes were cast before your eyes and onto your plate ,  topped with heavenly-rich whipped mascarpone and berries--just to name a few of my favorite selections .   and mind you ,  all of this was neverending .   it was hard not to feel as if i ' d been thrown back in time to join some greco-roman bacchanal of epic proportions--if only the backed bar stools on which we were perched were velvet divans !   going on my tenth oyster ,  under the disgusted gaze of my engorged fellow-diners ,  i moved a few centuries ahead to wonder if this was what lunch felt like to the average madison ave .  executive on a work day .  .  .   the only hitch was the wait staff seemed somewhat at a loss ,  constantly rushing about yet hard to flag for basic requests like new glasses and restocking plates ,  despite the mere handful of customers present--there couldn ' t have been more than 6-7 tables occupied total .   we had the sense they weren ' t accustomed to the buffet set-up ,  but they were cheerful and obliging and seemed to try their best to attend to us .   namecards for each dish would ' ve been helpful at the buffet as well as no menu was provided ,  but we could always ask servers if we couldn ' t do a visual id on a dish so that wasn ' t a huge issue .   if the mother ' s day buffet is any representation of grotto ' s daily fare ,  i ' ll certainly be back .   the decor ' s a little cheesy--think tuscan on a target / lowe ' s budget--but there ' s plenty of natural lighting and intimate nooks for any respectable lunch date / date night . 
__label__3 this is really just 2 . 5 stars .  i must have gone to a different grotto than the rest of you .  while it was just fine it was certainly nothing special .  the food was ok: overcooked salmon ,  good burger ,  fair meatballs .  our service ,  however ,  was actually comical .  it was not our servers fault .  he had clearly never been trained  ( at all )  .  he knew nothing about the menu ,  nothing about the bar .  he was nice as could be but had to leave to ask for answers to any questions that were asked .  the manager came by to ask how things were and we told him but it didn ' t really seem to have much impact .  also ,  they should really lose that tv in the dining room .  this is not some sports bar .  if someone that we are going out with wanted to go there that would be ok but otherwise i don ' t see us returning . 
__label__5 i ' m a fan of chill places like this .  i had a great 2 hour conversation with my friend just chilling here ,  having some wine and appetisers  ( muscles and meatballs - really good and big portion of muscles !  )  .  there was really good live music - just one guy singing and playing on the acoustic guitar and keyboard .  the real fire place in the back of the room gave the space a warm glow  ( and feeling !  )  .  the dark wood panelling and stone bar just added to the cool atmosphere .  i will definitely keep this place in mind as somewhere to hang out .  the wine i wanted even ended up being in stock which was a nice surprise because it was marked  ( by a dot sticker )  as being out of stock on the menu .  the waitress explained that the dot system had not been kept up to date lately since they were working without a hostess .  lack of a hostess ,  might explain why the opentable app would not connect to this place .  .  . 
__label__2 boooooooooo .   falsely - and aggressively - accused of trying to sneak in without paying ,  so that ' s a big minus right there .    once inside ,  i can say ,  hey ,  if you love having corporate rock and roll and all that goes with it shoved down your throat like a bag of dirty french fries ,  this may be the place for you . 
__label__5 great fun .  loved the exhibit on the 50th anniversary of the stones .  enjoyed the nostalgia of the music i started listening to in the late 50s .  my 16-year-old grandson enjoyed the history ,  but he also enjoyed the exhibits featuring newer bands . 
__label__3 so i am new to the area ,  and took my mother when she was visiting .   she would give the place 5 stars .   i think it is pretty cool and there are lots of interesting things to learn .   it is cool getting a behind the scenes look at your specific r&r stars and finding out who inspired them .   usually someone you have never heard of .   there is lots of cool pieces of memorabilia to look at .   there are also some pretty .  .  .  ' what the heck are you showing me that for '  pieces of memorabilia .   i don ' t really need to see a brianna dress .   i am not even sure anything she has or has done warrants being in the rrhof just yet .   there is a section as well dedicated to mtv .   i had to laugh because i was there at 12:01 am when  ' video killed the radio star '  first plaid .   it was exciting times .   but ,  when you read the history ,  they come up with some silly reasons why mtv is dead .   they think it was some slow burn .   flash to the r&r hall of fame .  .  .  ' yo mtv raps '  killed mtv .   it was a down hill slide from there .   anyway ,  it is an interesting place to spend a few hours .   if you are try music buff ,  you will love it . 
__label__5 i went and had a good time .  a lot of original things .  but i  ' m not really a looker when it comes to museums and i don ' t get moist looking at lyrics that jimi hendrix wrote . but i did enjoy the aspect of it .  it was pretty cool to walk through the hall ,  pop my ear buds in and crank my beatles sound track to drown out everything around me .    it ' s on the lake so it means you get a pretty cool looking view of boats and stuff .    really i have nothing to say .  pretty cool place .  worth the money if you like old r n r stuff . 
__label__5 i take the negative reviews with a grain of salt .   almost all negative reviews are from people w no pics and less than 10 total reviews .   again ,  this is where yelp needs to police these reviews better .   i couldn ' t be happier with my purchase of dining room table .  .  . buffet table and complete living room sectional .   joe eungard was the best and i would ask for him again .   helped me through the process .  .  . wasnt at all pushy .   he showed me many options .  .  . kept in touch through the process .   delivery on table and sectional were three weeks as he explained but worth it .   the money i saved when after i researched these prices elsewhere was worth the wait .   again .  .  . i will buy again from these guys .   i even go in there and just walk around and get new ideas .  .  .  . joe explained they get new inventory all the time .   the website is even bigger .   worth the wait people . 
__label__5 awesome service !  thank you dustin .  they have a great selection for great prices .  very happy we came here . 
__label__4 the glitz !  the glamor !  and ,  currently ,  the grateful dead !  this seems like the thing to do ,  as a minnesotan visiting cleveland .   i like music .  and i like staring at stuff .  putting those two things together seems like win-win for me ,  right ?  sure !  the only thing that gets me down is the price to walk through this joint .  $22 ?  but they take your photo !   and match it up to some rock and roll themed back drop !  oh ,  but they charge you $25 for the photos .  hmmm .  rock and roll ,  y u be so expensive !  !  !  !  i wonder if jim morrison knows you ' re making a cash cow out of his report card .   admission fee complaints aside ,  i had a great time wandering around here and gawking at stuff .  i enjoyed the random memorabilia ,   like the hate letter written to the rolling stones from some school kid in fiji ,  or ,  as mentioned before ,  jim morrison ' s report card and class photo ,  some drawings of football players and medieval warriors done by jimi hendrix ,  and an un-dipped sheet of janis joplin blotter acid .  the outfits were the best part for me ,  i loved seeing the sequined dresses of the supremes ,   the flowy witchy dresses of stevie nicks ,   the funky colors of george clinton ' s get up ,  and the small tailored suits worn by james brown or mick jagger .  it was amusing to see clothing worn by these larger-than-life rock stars ,  because you were able to get a sense of their stature  and real life proportions .  conclusion: all rock stars are actually really short little marvelous people .   the grateful dead exhibit was a little minimalist .  i really thought there would be more on display .  the dead had such a colorful following  and had some really neat artwork flowing through their community .  i thought there would be more of the hippie culture on display ,  but it was really sparse .  sadly ,  my favorite part of the whole dead exhibit was the 5-7  envelopes that were kept from the days that they had a ticket give away .  the envelopes were colorful and depicted the flavor of the times ,  vibrant and psychedelic ,  creative and lazily skillful .  i thought for sure i would be overwhelmed with tie dyed shirts ,   patchouli oils and those damned bears ,  but sadly ,  the exhibit for this funky bunch was lacking .  true fans ,  stay away ,  don ' t bother .  you ' re better off getting blazed in your van while listening  to touch of gray .    overall ,  worth it . 
__label__4 make sure you see the lower level  ( below the entry level )  .  it is not very well marked .  no big signs telling the visitors all the artifacts and displays that are located there .  this has the best displays and is as big as the all the upper levels combined .  the lower level has most and best of the artifacts .   we saw the upper levels in about 60 to 90 minutes ,  including watching some videos .  then spent 90 plus minutes in the lowest level .    if you miss this level ,  then you have wasted your money !  !  !  !  !   overall it is worth the entry fee .  a outstanding music collection the you can access from many individual kiosks .  i could have stayed much longer just listening to tunes . 
__label__4 i couldn ' t care less for the interactive videos and headphones-i found the touchscreens to be slow and i ' m impatient .  gift shops bore me ,  who needs more crap to drag home ?  i did love the artifacts and costumes !  i don ' t think we saw everything because we were in a rush and my feet still hurt from cedar point the day before .  i would be far happier if rush and cheap trick were inducted-if they are important enough to be included in the artifacts ,  then they belong in the hall as inductees . 
__label__4 i ' ve been wanting to come here for years ,  but haven ' t had the chance until now to get here .   i ' m a huge music lover ,  and was happy to have the chance to see everything they had to offer .   walking in ,  the place is pretty cool to look at .  it ' s a big glass triangle ,  and when you walk in ,  there ' s music playing with staff everywhere .   they had some stuff cool cars hanging from the ceiling and lots to look at .   they have a little bit of everything here ,  with loads of history to read and look at .   it ' s not in any particular order ,  but it ' s all spread out over several floors of displays .   on the ground floor they had a ton of cool stuff .   elvis ,  the hollies and so many more .   stuff like guitars ,  pictures ,  coats and it was an amazing collection of stuff .   i wasn ' t here to see any one display in particular ,  but to see everything i could .  i love everything from motown ,  classic rock ,  up to lady gaga and taylor swift .   they had this one section with beyonce ' s outfits ,  bootsie klien ' s fur coats ,  a tribute to metalicca and so much more .  they also had a section of les paul guitars as well .   even though i had fun ,  it was a bit much to take in .  i really need to go back again to read and visit since it was a bit of sensory overload for me when i was there the first time .   this place is loaded with history ,  and totally worth the trip .   they have a great gift shop ,  but some of the clothing is a bit pricey .  they also have a few movies showing the inductees as well . 
__label__3 what you would expect .  .  .  . expensive and crowded .  there are better places to visit while in cleveland; the museum of art is free and awesome .  not into paying a ton of money to see a bunch of rock star soiled britches on a mannequin . 
__label__2 i ' ll start this off the same way i tell people about this: if you ' re passing by or through cleveland ,  by all means stop and visit .   however ,  don ' t make a special trip to see this ,  as i did .   there are many interesting exhibits and video presentations .   i was thrilled to see the car from the zz top videos  ( would be nice if the gift shop sold models of it )  .   there were costumes ,  instruments ,  sheet music ,  hand-written notes ,  cars ,  motorcycles ,  and other items related to the inductees .   the multi-screen presentation of the hall ' s inductees is a fun watch .   of course ,  there are debates over who has been voted in and who hasn ' t .   i still can ' t understand why the moody blues aren ' t in there .   typical overpriced gift shop that you find at such museums .   had much more fun at the pro football hall of fame not too far away in canton . 
__label__4 i thought it was great .  i went there on a trip with my school band .   the store was very strange .  they had all types of music from different eras but i could not find a "blur" or "gorillaz" cd .  i was very dissapointed to see they had costumes on display of britany spears .  not cool .  neither "rock" nor "roll" .  i understand its a museum and she is not actually an inductee ,  but come on ,  get that pop crap outa there . 
__label__5 i saw exactly what i wanted to see and got exactly the experience i was expecting from this center for rock and roll culture and history .  enough said ! 
__label__4 this is a fascinating museum ,  filled with rich history ,  colorful stories  ( and characters )  ,  and vibrant ,  evocative  (  ?  )  displays -- audio and visual -- covering rock and roll from its roots to the present .   the number and diversity of  ' artifacts '   ( photos ,  instruments ,  clothes ,  etc .  )  is amazing ,  and the signage for the most part is outstanding -- colorful and informative .   the pretty building has great views of downtown cleveland and the lake through the windows .   elevators ,  escalators ,  ramps  ( and stairs )  take you among the seven floors of exhibitions .   the price is steep at $24  ( $22+tax )  ,  but it was an enjoyable time .    ( to me ,  $15 is where the price should be .  )   when i visited ,  the only disappointment to me was the "video killed the radio star" exhibit -- located at the end of interesting exhibit on how commercial audiences receive / access music ,  this part is basically a single  ( though informative )  sign about the rise and fall of music videos and an art installation of numerous television screens showing video clips .   however ,  the installation shows only one video at a time at once on all the screens -- this may make it easier to hear the music from that one video ,  but it seemed like a wasted opportunity to show more of the diverse wealth of videos . 
__label__4 disney world for rock history nerds .  i could have done with a little less rock stars '  clothing and more interactive displays ,  but still something everyone needs to see once . 
__label__1 i have gone to this one multiple times just hoping that it ' ll change but it never will the service is absolutely horrible it ' s always a terrible wait and nothing is ever right not only that but it ' s disappointing to wait that long just to get an order that ' s messed up and has to be sent back it ' s also not the cleanest i have noticed that everytime i ' m there the tables and booths even the menus just feel sticky and unclean
__label__5 this is my first time at this location we had a great server named melissa she was very attentive food was great we were seated fast and all staff was friendly  .  when you enter you have to veer off to the left or you will be at steak and shake there is alot of vacant property around but conveniently located off transportation blvd off 480 .  kudos applebees . 
__label__2 i used to frequent this nasty  sad meat-market  dive bar when i was training in ohio for a job .  i was staying across the street in a hotel for month ,  and it was walking distance from my rooms .   it was loud ,  cool / uncool  ,  and dirty .  dark walls .  .  . sticky floors ,  retro bands ,  black ceiling  (  you get the picture )   the clientele is bad to worse .  . could be fun depending on your age ,  state of mind and  ( sketchy )  marital status .   had big fun ,  small bar tabs and huge hangovers from a place about 50% dangerous ,  in the burbs of cleveland .   great dive bar .  .  .  .  .  . bad everything else
__label__4 a really fun place with some great displays and memorabilia .   staff was very helpful and friendly and very accommodating to me as a nursing mom . 
__label__5 i ' ve been to the rock hall 4 times .  the past 2 times we went there for the "best of cleveland" party and we were able to tour the new exhibits after we finished our beverages .  its best to watch the introductory film then tour the fashion gallery .  .  we try to go there on free days .  the food is overpriced
__label__2 won ' t walk through these doors until the mighty j .  geils band is finally in !  !  !  so many non rock n roll people in ,  that shouldn ' t be !  ! 
__label__5 talkin '   ' bout a revolution  i had goosebumps the entire time .  seven floors of rock n roll history !  not just rock history but american history .  not just american history ,  but cultural history--cultural history that changed the world forever .   this isn ' t just  a collection of guitars and costumes .  this is a dynamic historical museum ,  where every floor is a new decade ,  and you get to experience history in the making with every step you take ,  no pun intended .     the use of multimedia is nothing short of exquisite .  from the listening booths to the jukeboxes ,  to the films .  oh ,  the films !  the films were extraordinary .  first you get this excellent sound quality because the museum has invested in the best sound equipment .  then you get the finest filmmakers with a topic that can ' t go wrong .    i was there all day .  i read every placard ,  studied every photograph and every poster ,  and saw every film .  and yes ,  i marveled for hours at janis joplin ' s hand-painted porsche ,  pondered george clinton ' s furry boot collection ,  and got goosebumps when i saw stevie nicks ' s gowns .  i think i saw grown men cry at the site of all the electric guitars once held by their guitar heroes .  i ' m not even much of a guitar solo kind of woman ,  but i too was struck with awe seeing this amazing collection .    i learned so much american history here ,  more than i ever did in school ,  from the great depression  ( which spawned rock n roll )  ,  racism ,  oppression ,  politics ,  drugs ,  civil rights ,  mccarthyism ,  political corruption .  the exhibit on censorship in the 50s was nothing short of fascinating ,  and i pondered my school days again .  how would it have been if curators such as these designed school curriculum ?  they make history not just relevant but poignant .   then with the 60s ,  you get the british invasion era .  all of a sudden everything is in color ,  like crossing into oz .  you get a totally new sound in music ,  and you get examples of world history ,  british history ,  and the history of imperialism .  through it all ,  you get the voices in rock no roll that changed and continue to change the world .    rock n roll was the instrument of revolution .  you can ' t leave this place without a better appreciation of the human spirit .   p . s .  for a good chuckle ,  take a close look at the mannequins wearing mick jagger ' s jumpsuits .  no detail was omitted . 
__label__5 ever wanted to see a kiss member ' s boot up close ?  how about john lennon ' s outfit from the sgt .  pepper ' s lonely hearts club band album ?  janis joplin ' s porsche ?  michael jackson ' s glove ?  well guess what- it ' s all here .  which ,  if you ' re big into music ,   is super-duper exciting !  needless to say ,  i was in love with this place when i came to visit .  i have been dying to visit this place since i moved to ohio ,  and i ' m glad that i wasn ' t disappointed .  my personal favorite exhibits were the costume exhibit  ( outfits from the supremes ,  zztop ,  michael jackson ,  david bowie ,  steve nicks ,  etc etc )  ,  the beatles collection ,  and the cities and sounds exhibit  ( covers notable time periods in different cities ,  like memphis in the 50s ,  san francisco in the late 60s ,  seattle in the late 80s to early 90s )  .     the one downside is the no photos rule- there were a few pieces i wish i could get a photo of  ( janis joplin ' s car is so cool !  )  .   parking is also not free  ( we parked in a $10 lot : /  )  .   other than that ,  the museum is great !  !  !  definitely a must-see if you are ever in the cleveland area !     also ,  to the military members and dependents out there- there is a military discount here !  $17 tickets ,  as opposed to the normal $22 . 
__label__3 rock and roll historical experience with plenty to see ,  too much to read with minimum required interaction .   in other words ,  i wanted more rock & roll "action" and less snore fest .   as much as i like to acquire fascinating knowledge and observe high tech machinery of it ' s time ,  it was the typical museum {and gift shop} not for the younger kiddies or the easily bored .     rock and roll music is energetic ,  emotional ,  fun but the museum is dull ,  emotionless and boring .   i though if any museum would make a museum less educational and more music flowing through your veins ,  bang your hand on walls ,  rock & roll hof and museum would be it .   the wow moments did come even if far and few and that ' s based on your individual rock & roll backgrounds .   for myself it was the pink floyd: the wall ,  the evolution of music playing machines all the way up to the ipod ,  lady gaga ' s "meat dress" and elvis .   the building architecture is also another highlight not to be missed but i ' m sure if you visit the museum you ' ll get to appreciate it . 
__label__5 we loved it  so worth the trip .   be sure you go into the theatre where they show the induction ceremonies .  we were there for 3 . 5 hours & were enthralled .  cleveland rocks  folks
__label__3 worth going to if you happen to be in cleveland .  certainly not worth going out of your way to see since there is really nothing else in cleveland . 
__label__5 all i have to say about mootown is .  .  .  .  yes !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !   mootown is a great place !   the cow spots over everything  ( sometimes including the staff !  )  is fantastic ,  not to mention the amazing ice cream !   if you like coldstone you will ditch the stone for this less expensive ,  homegrown ,  higher quality version .   i love mixing the dark chocolate with black raspberry and brownie bits !   it might sound odd ,  but try it and i promise you ' ll love it ! 
__label__5 "there ' s rosemary ,  that ' s for remembrance; pray ,  love ,  remember: and there is pansies .  that ' s for thoughts .  .  .  .  there ' s fennel for you ,  and columbines: there ' s rue for you; and here ' s some for me: we may call it herb-grace o '  sundays: o you must wear your rue with a difference .  there ' s a daisy: i would give you some violets .  .  . "  oh don ' t worry ,  you won ' t find me drowned and flower strewn in the river .   on the contrary .   i ' ve been getting a steady supply of lovely flowers from wilhelmy ' s lately .   mon cher chou is a darling ,  n ' est-ce pas ?     their flowers are always very fresh and hardy .   the arrangements are classic without being cliche ,  interesting without being obtuse .  each arrangement is really very artistic and obviously well thought out .   i ' ve used them for events and they have always gone far above and beyond what i expected-- even when i was expecting their usual brilliance . 
__label__2 so ,  this is essentially a knockoff chipotle / qdoba located on / by cleveland state ' s campus .  i ordered from here off of uber eats .  the food quality / taste was just "ok" . 
__label__3 i wish i was in the mood for a beer; i liked the names of their beers for sure !  with that said ,  the wife and i stopped on a layover and the smell of delicious burgers at dinner time tempted us .  i had the old world burger which was cooked correctly ,  served with a bit of bbq sauce and onions on a pretzel bun and was tasty but quite dry as was the        cole slaw i had on the side .  the wife had the standard pub burger which she enjoyed .    service was adequate .  i felt no reason to tip higher than 15 percent which is on the low side for me ,  but adequate is as accurate as i can describe . 
__label__1 considering the fact that it ' s inside of a terminal ,  the food is okay .  i docked a couple stars mainly because our of our waitress .  my group was already in a not so great mood because we had a hard time checking our bags in with the idiots at united airlines .  then had to deal with the rude meat head tsas .    our waitress ,  melissa ,  was impatient from the moment we walked in .   we only asked a couple questions regarding the sizes of the beers we ordered .  i was only curious !  i didn ' t know it was such rocket science to show us the sizes of the beers .    our food finally came out .  as she was walking away to get us some plates ,  i quickly tried to get her attention to ask for some hot sauce .  i thought she didn ' t hear me since she didn ' t turn around when i asked her .   she brought over a couple of plates for us and the top plate was dirty .  she quickly tried to get the piece of old food off the plate while i wasn ' t looking .  when she realized i saw her hide the piece of crumb ,  she quickly made a comment about how it had a small crumb and tried to brush it off .    she didn ' t stop by once to see if we needed anything or asked how our food was .  overall ,   our waitress was a b*tch and made me even happier to be leaving ohio .   peace out you boring ass state . 
__label__3 on my way back to houston ,  tx ,  i laid over at cleveland ,  oh .  i looked at this place in concourse c from the outside and thought ,  "why not ?  ?  ?  let ' s give it a try . " it was an average experience .   i had the amber lager and creole gumbo .  lager = good ,  gumbo= no go .  i was disappointed in the food ,  but the beerwas good .  not a total loss .  i recommend this to business traveler ,  traveling on a company expense account with time to kill . 
__label__4 had a really great beer and a very yummy hamburger .  enjoyed this place ,  if you have a layover make a stop and grab a beer . 
__label__3 i struggle with this since i know it is an airport location ,  i should expect high prices and bad service but i just want to warn other travelers .  they get 5 stars for the amazing beer that i love ,  they lose 1 star for terrible service and another for ridiculous prices .    i paid $7 . 20 for a "short" beer ,  the holy moses belgian white ale was amazingly delicious but $7 . 20 is just stupid .   they weren ' t terribly busy ,  when the gentleman next to me sat down and asked the bartender what beer he should get the waitress pointed to the menu and said "that ' s why i gave you the menu" and turned around .  i know it is an airport and they are under pressure to get people out the door very quickly but you opened a brewpub ,  you should at least attempt to educate people about your beer especially since you sell 6 packs to go . 
__label__5 fast friendly service .  this is my favorite restaurant in the cle airport .  it is comfortable ,  not just wooden chairs and flimsy tables ,  this is a legit bar / restaurant with a full menu .   the selection of beer is nice ,  light to dark for all palettes .   when i have had to fly into or through cle ,  i always stop here .  the food is very good and the portions are large enough to share .  the burgers have always been prepared "medium" as i requested .  2 out of 2 is good for me .  the fact they have a burger on a pretzel bun ,  a good pretzel bun would have me coming back .  the pretzel bun they use is a little sweet and it is moist and fresh .   the caesar salad was cool ,  crisp and fresh and if you like cheese .  .  . you will love theirs .   the service is fast ,  so if you are connecting and have at least an hour ,  don ' t worry ,  they will get you through without you feeling like you are being rushed or late .  i never found myself craning my neck looking for the server ,  they are active and visible and again ,  very friendly ! 
__label__3 sandwich was surprisingly good .  the onion rings were terrible .  the beer was local and was great for before a flight .  they should stop showing cnn tho .  esp on a day when there was a plane crash . 
__label__5 katie is the best !   i ' ve gotten so many compliments on my cut / color .   she just opened this new salon after working at a salon in chagrin falls; she ' s really creative and fun !   go ! 
__label__5 i was in cleveland for a wedding over the weekend .   i booked an appointment for a blowout with some curls .   the salon is super cute and i love that they are an aveda salon !  cleveland downtown doesnt offer much for salons so it was nice to have found this place .   everyone was very friendly and katie was awesome !  i got a complimentary facial and the coffee while waiting was really good .  katie took great care and i got a ton of compliments at the wedding .  will definitely go back next time i am in cleveland . 
__label__5 best gel manicure i ' ve ever had  ( photo taken almost a week on )  .  dani is wonderful and they have a great color selection - whole batch of new colors came in while i was there .  lovely cozy salon ,  very cute and great atmosphere .  this will be my new go-to spot ! 
__label__5 star pop is one of the many great and independently owned shops on waterloo rd .  troy ,  the proprietor ,  offers an amazing selection of vintage toys ,  collectibles ,  clothing ,  and various other kitschy knick-knacks and overall great stuff .   while it is a small space ,  it is packed to the gills with this stuff ,  and there are tons of great finds !  pretty much everything is second-hand ,  which provides an affordable and sustainable option for folks who are collectors ,  want to buy some fun stuff for kids ,  or simply want to take a walk down memory-lane .    troy is constantly on the hunt for new and great stuff to offer ,  and he is very passionate about it which makes for an excellent shopping experience .  he is so committed ,  in fact ,  that if you happen to be out after store hours at the beachland or some other local haunt ,  he very well may have a sign on his door with his phone number letting potential customers know that he can pop back in at a moment ' s notice to let you shop .  that is a dedicated store-owner ! 
__label__4 basically big fun with old clothes and records instead of kitschy cards and books .   theres a really wide variety of stuff here .  i found philip glass next to david bowie and frank zappa in the records ,  and classic raggedy anne books next to some stuff i read as a kid that i forgot about .   for such a small place theres so much to look through ,  and it really warrants a visit if you ' re on waterloo .  the size is maybe the only problem ,  its just filled to bursting . 
__label__4 below is a list of the star pop inventory that very well could have been taken directly from my childhood home:  -cartoon-charactered lunchboxes -new kids on the block dolls ,  t-shirts ,  and posters -star wars glasses from the burger king kids '  meal -boglins  ( omg !  remember those ?  )  -care bears  ( plush ,  figurines ,  wall hangings ,  etc .  )  -my little ponies -snorks  (  !  !  )  -a host of nintendo games  ( the ones i  were able to see included metroid ,  operation wolf ,  and q-bert )  -garbage pail kids -transformers -the sesame street house  ( you know the one !  )  with other fisher-price toys and figurines -strawberry shortcake dolls  i wonder how this guy managed to get into my old house and take all this stuff ?  !  ?  !  ?  : )   they also have a nice selection of vintage clothes  ( adult and kid sizes )  ,  books ,  and movies .  i got a care bear  ( cheer bear )  that matches the one i have from my youth ,  which my husband was just about to kill me for still owning !  now i can give this new one to our kid .  cheer bear lives on !  my husband got two boxes of nfl trading cards .  to each his own .  loved this place ! 
__label__5 i ' ve picked up everything at star pop from board games and books for my kids to vintage ties and clothing for myself .  troy ,  the owner ,  has even called me months later to let me know he found things i ' d forgotten i ever requested !   troy has a keen eye and a sharp memory ,  and he travels constantly to add to his inventory .  the ever-evolving selection at star pop is terrific ,  and troy is knowledgeable about every single item in the store .    well worth planning to spend some extra time on waterloo !    ( also ,  star pop does accept credit cards now via square !  ) 
__label__5 beautiful job with the redesign .  i ' ve been to this park several times over the summer and am very impressed .  glad there is a park like this in cleveland ,  it was definitely needed .    good choice on rebol ,  love the cafe and open seating outside ,  great place to grab a drink or meal . 
__label__5 awesome place !  learned to brew from these guys in one of their classes and got my money ' s worth just in drinks and food ,  not to mention the expert knowledge bestowed !  they have everything you need to get started brewing and then some ,  from ingredients ,  to equipment ,  to a friendly and knowledgeable staff .    also ,  they recently opened up their own brew pub over in ohio city ,  platform brewery ,  where their expertise is on display .  impressive stuff !   i ' ve brewed about 10 batches always getting stuff from here ,  including random online recipes ,  and they have always had the hops ,  grains ,  and yeast i ' ve needed
__label__5 love this place .  best home brew supply shop in the state !  reed and paul are super awesome .  if they don ' t have what you need they will special order it for you .  definitely worth a trip .  check it out . 
__label__5 i had to have a root canal and like most people ,  i don ' t like dentists .   after having one of the worst visits with a different dentist ,  dr feldman was one of the kindest and gentlest doctor ' s i have had the privilege of having work on my teeth .   they say this man has written the book on how to numb a patient up ,  and that is true .   it took about 20 minutes for him to do all the injections ,  but when he was done ,  he could have removed my jaw and i wouldn ' t have felt it .   i really liked how he listened to all my fears and concerns ,  and reassured me that i would be okay .   during the procedure he took his time telling me if we need to stop ,  that it is okay .   all along the way he told me what he was doing ,  and i felt absolutely no pain during he procedure .   this man and his staff are a true blessing ! 
__label__5 great market .  para nuestros hispanos es el mejor lugar en cleveland para encontrar bastantes productos hispanos .  tienen una buena selecciif3n de todos tipos de frijoles ,  chorizos ,  carnes ,  quesos ,  pescado .  los empleados son sifaper atentos . 
__label__1 i ' ve been a customer of pse credit union for years .  i used to think so highly of them and always enjoyed doing business with them .  loan department was so nice when i was borrowing money from them ,  but today .  .  .  .  . i want to pay off my loan .  .  . pay off .  what a freaking hassle .  not to mention how condensending and patronizing the vice president of the bank was to me .  how dare you ?  i moved to another state and paying off a loan and having new address updated on their system is a fiasco .   i am deeply hurt how i was talked to and treated .  very upset .  shame on you vice president of pse shame on you !  ! 
__label__5 i had a great experience at this salon last weekend .  my hair needed trimming ,  i had split edges .  i called the salon and they were able to accommodate and squeeze me into their schedule within 20 mins .   donnettte - hairstylist- was friendly and very professional .  she knew how to handle my wavy / cutely hair ,  unlike many salons that seemed to be puzzled by it .   the other salons would treat it as if it ' s diseased and i ' d leave the salon very annoyed ,  especially because they typically change 50-60$ for the haircut .   this hairstylist knew what to ask and how to cut and i ' m extremely happy with the result .  oh and the price was less than half what i pay at the other salons .   i would defiantly come back: 1 .  professional hairstylist 2 .  friendly staff  3 .  reasonable prices 4 .  flexible schedule   yey : )  i don ' t need to look any more : ) 
__label__1 ive been to razors edge 2 times and recieved bad haircuts .  i try and support the community but will never go back to this spot and i recommend people not to go here .  the last time i went ,  the front of my head was about an inch long and then there were spots that were about 3 inches long .  i had a date that night i got home and had to try and fix what she messed up .  that happened both times i went
__label__5 the rock & roll hall of fame was really cool .  a lot of music history .  i went in july 2015 .  enjoyed the paul simon exhibit ,  which was a limited time exhibit .  my brother and i were there for about 2 . 5 hours .   if you ' ve never been ,  this place is a must do .  for me ,  it is something i really enjoyed ,  but probably won ' t do again for quite some time .   a must do for any rolling stones ,  elvis ,  pink floyd ,  and beatles fans .   i ' m a big fan of billy joel .  was happy to see him represented throughout the place . 
__label__5 5 star event !   wife n i took he kids this time .  .  .  music transcends generations .   kids dancing around to elvis ,  beatles ,  stones , who  ( their grandparents generation )  .  .  .  guns n roses ,  beastie boys  ( my generation )  and tons of others .   kids singing alice cooper  ( what kid doesn ' t like "schools out )  ,  led zeppelin on the numerous music kiosks throughout the bldg . 
__label__4 this museum is so much fun .  it is pretty ,  clean ,  and has a great layout .  there ' s a good balance between the displays and the information that is posted .  a large range era ,  genre ,  and display type are covered ,  which keeps everyone engaged for the visit .  it is updated fairly often ,  so i will be sure to include it in my semi annual visits to the area . 
__label__3 the rock hall is hit or miss depending on the exhibit that ' s in place .  i will say ,  it has fantastic views of the lake .   when i went their ,  the main exhibit was on pop artist ' s stage wardrobes .  they were displaying outfits worn by britney spears ,  nsync ,  michael jackson and the like .  not really my cup of tea .   i have heard that some people really enjoyed different exhibits ,  so i would definitely go if there was something new that i was actually interested in seeing ,  but i think you can safely have a good time in cleveland without making this a must-see . 
__label__5 summer in the city concert series in more than worth coming down on a wednesday for . 
__label__5 up in the highest tower of the rock and roll hall of fame i saw the dresses of the motown stars .  quite an experience .  as a whole ,  the museum is a hoot .    irony: i haven ' t seen even one of cleveland ' s other cultural institutions .  and i ' m a total museum lover ,  from the louvre and the tate modern to the vatican and the uffizi; from the prado to the berlin museum; from the la county museum of art and norton simon in pasadena to the national gallery on the mall in washington .  someday i ' ll get to see the art museum in cleveland ! 
__label__4 i ' ve been in here twice in the past ,  but never paid the entry fee to see the entire exhibit .  this time i did ,  and i must say i enjoyed my time there although i ' m not an avid music fan .   while the exhibits are moderately entertaining ,  the highlight is the building itself ,  designed by i . m . pei it is absolutely beautiful .  as you ascend ,  each floor necessarily becomes smaller and has less to offer ,  but the view is marvelous .   think a little louvre .  very cool .   a fun  time . 
__label__5 the museum was really great and expertly curated .   there was a lot of history that i loved ,  as well as context ,  roots ,  and influences that were so interesting ,  as well as photos ,  costumes ,  guitars ,  etc .   my only complaint was that the video about all the inductees had soundclips and videos of some of the artists but not all .   aren ' t all inductees equal ?   the bruce springsteen exhibit was quite interesting  .  .  .  great videos ,  great memorabilia  ( including handbills advertising concerts to see the boss in various bars and small venues for under $3 .   how awesome would that have been !     all in all ,  a great ,  great museum .   we spent about 3 . 5 hours there  .  .  .  could have been longer but my wife and daughter were antzy to go .   the views by the lake were great as well ,  as is the architecture of the museum .  . 
__label__1 overpriced tasteless food .   white castle has way better hamburgers .   too bad one of the very few public places on the lake has such terrible food . 
__label__2 krusty ' s is always fun in august but that is only one day and has nothing to do with sunset grille .  i might as well sit at edgewater park and listen to isis ,  sleep ,  kyuss or pelican ,  think about what stoner rock means to me and how it makes life better . 
__label__1 terrible terrible terrible soda that tasted just like syrup ,  absolutely disgusting .  .  .  the fries weren ' t even warm and i got told i couldn ' t have more than 1 sauce for my ten chicken nuggets .  terrible customer service never coming back if i ' m in the area again
__label__1 roar boom fireballs  wow wow - this is how we kill  recruiters wet dream .    sorry ,  but all of these multimillion dollar death machines creep me out .   carry on . 
__label__5 excellent babes ,  very friendly ,  takes walk ins .  downstairs follow the hallway to the right . 
__label__4 love the rock hall .  it ' s a staple of cleveland ,  and proof that the city is the home of rock and roll .   4 stars because i think they could take better care of the memorabilia .  however ,  it ' s important that this place exists .  the pilgrimage is worth it . 
__label__4 good for tourists but i ' d say not so good for locals .  very cool to see ,  but honestly i ' d say it ' s not worth the exorbitant admission price .  if you ever have out of town visitors coming i ' d say it ' s definitely worth bringing them there when you actually have an excuse to spend the money . 
__label__5 wow !   this place is great !   a lot of nice exhibits .   they really put a lot of thought and research in it .    i really liked the 1 hit wonder kiosk . 
__label__5 this was fantastic !  we spent the entire day here  ( 10 am - 5 pm )  and were very impressed by how well this was put together .  there were certainly groups and people that we were surprised not to see here ,  but the displays were well done ,  the videos were terrific ,  and we especially appreciated how they made connections between groups and what was going on in society and politics and how each influenced the other .  fascinating ! 
__label__3 i ' ve been here three times now ,  and each time i find it more and more not up to snuff .  yes i know ,  people are saying "joe ,  what exactly are you looking for ,  this is the history of rock and roll ,  the music you were brought up on ! "  the first time i walked in i was bored ,  really bored .  it wasn ' t until i got to the 70 ' s section that i finally felt like i was "really here ,  i ' m at the rock & roll hof ! " wow !    seeing contracts signed by ringo starr ' s mother for the family ' s first television ,  roy orbison ' s doctor ' s signature for his eye class scripts ,  and  jim  morrison ' s kidney stone did nothing for me .  i mean ,  come on !  i think some things are historic ,  some things are just used to make the museum just look more important than it needs to be .  seriously ,  if you want to see really great rock memorabilia just go to any hard rock cafe .   now back to the hof ,  when i got to the 70 ' s section ,  it was cool to see elton john ' s piano ,  sunglasses ,  and outfits ,  the man was seriously flamboyant back in the day wasn ' t he ?  then the 80 ' s section with the zztopp roadster ,  furry guitars ,  and set .  the pink floyd exhibit was great ,  the jimi hendrix film that showed in one of the theaters was brilliant .  then ,  seeing all the inductees on the wall of fame ,  i was awe struck .    to sum it all up ,  the r&r hof has a really boring section that ' s the fifties and up until 1965 ,  then it really gets exciting from then on .  to some people older than myself that were listening to music in the fifties  ( i was born in the sixties )  i apologize for saying your era was boring ,  but really ,  as billy joel said "everybody ' s talking bout the new sounds ,  funny ,  but it ' s still rock and roll to me"
__label__4 definitely put this on your to do list if you find yourself visiting the cleveland area !    this place was huge and a real treat to see .   plan to spend at least 3-4 hours here if you really want to see everything .   parking is easy as there is a garage accessible to this museum and the surrounding attractions . 
__label__3 as a huge music fan ,  i was at the rock and roll hall of fame when it opened in 1995 .  my most recent visit last weekend i was really surprised that the museum hasn ' t really changed much since it opened .  they ran out of room for the hall of fame portion of the museum ,  it originally was on the top floor ,  so its moved to the 4th floor several years ago .  the first floor basically is just about the same since it opened .  there is a section now on impact of music from cleveland / akron area and ohio .  the black keys were definitely a focus of this section ,  since they ' re doing so well and from akron .  they even had afghan whigs featured in the cincinnati area .  i saw them many a times at bogarts in cincinnati .  the third floor has video about the history of mtv and they have not touched the video ,  me and a friend watched it twice ,  if you ' re a child of the mtv generation as i am you will enjoy it ,  but you can see how dated it is ,  but also mtv has changed and doesn ' t play music videos anymore .  fifth and six floors has a special grateful dead exhibit .  they did have the 2012 inductees and a few items from the new inductees on display .  they also had some new items on display ,  which were from a few artists i don ' t think are hall of fame worthy ,  katy perry ,  lady gaga ,  skillrex ,  the decemberists or is it to just add some items from some newer musicians to attract younger attendees ?  good to see the cbgb awning has found a home ,  but we only stumbled upon it from the basement entrance door .   good attraction for cleveland ,  but they need to make some changes to attract repeat visitors . 
__label__3 this is neat to see but i don ' t know that i ' d make a point to come back .  it was cool to see pop culture icons like a real sgt pepper costume and michael jackson ' s glove as well as pieces of handwritten lyrics but there were a lot of artists that have made big impacts who were not represented with any memorabilia .   the architecture of the building is very unique and just fun to look at that .  we liked sitting on the patio outside the cafe and overlooking the water .  parking was $8 which isn ' t horrible for an attraction such as this .  take advantage of the student discount if you are able  ( $18 rather than $22 )  or other coupons that you can find .  we got a little snack in the cafe which wasn ' t horribly priced either . 
__label__4 do i love rock music ?  yes  do i love seeing items from the bands i love ?  yes !   do i enjoy rock music history ?  yes !   do i like waiting in long lines ?  no !   we came to ohio for a wedding one weekend .  so i ' m gonna take advantage of that and come to the rock hall of fame !    we got here around 11am on an off season saturday .  so it wasn ' t really all that bad getting in .  as we went down stairs we sat in line to watch the first video about the different sounds of rock and roll .  it was a 12 minute long video from the beginning of rock and roll until modern day rock and roll .   ( damn how man times will i say rock and roll ?  !  :p )   after that we got to go down stairs where most of the museum is .  here you will find listening stations and items from the bands .  you can take photos here but just can ' t have your flash on .    followed by a few more smaller floors of music history and even more items !  most of the items are labeled and give you some of the items history .   each floor has staff posted .  they are there if you have any questions or need help finding your way around .    my only issue with the hall of fame is are the lines for the listening station .  they should have someone posted there to make sure the lines move at a good rate .  i sat around for about 40 minutes before i gave up .  it was just annoying .  otherwise it was awesome to see the videos !  they did a great job making it interesting and educational as well .   it will cost you $22 . 00 per adult and $12 per child .  so its not cheap .  but you get hours of fun !  we spent about 4-5 hours there alone .  its worth checking out ! 
__label__3 good and bad .  the good is that it is chock full of great exhibits that are well organized and interesting to a wide variety of music fans .  i really appreciated the mellencamp and the rolling stone magazine exhibit which was the best part of the experience .  the not so good - needs significantly more space .  it was like sardines in a can .  no obvious traffic flow so everyone was stepping in front of ,  bumping into and blocking everyone else .  it was two floors up until you could start to enjoy the exhibits .  additionally ,  getting down from the top floors was difficult .  couldn ' t walk back because it was like salmon swimming upstream .  elevators were too slow and too small to use .  i drove two hours to enjoy myself ,  not be stressed out .  and at $25 it really didn ' t make for the best experience . 
__label__4 absolutely love the rock and roll hall of fame !  !  !  i was lucky enough to catch the "women who rock" exhibit ,  in which outfits from very popular celebrities were displayed ,  including britney spears '  infamous nude jeweled body suit ,  lady gaga ' s meat dress  ( minus the fresh meat )  ,  and outfits from artists like rihanna ,  beyonce and christina aguilera .  outside of this exhibit ,  there were outfits and props from all of music based celebrities ,  which was really fun to walk through and learn about !  i would definitely go back to the rock and roll hall of fame !  it is worth the price with all of the floors and celebrity installations !  don ' t forget to check out the massive sized musical instruments as soon as you walk in  ( you can ' t miss it !  ) 
__label__4 never been before and i am a music fan .  it was cool to see the old memorabilia from all the greats who came before .  i wish they had a little more items from patsy cline as she is a great influence on my singing and i ' m her name sake .  but overall it was awesome .  being able to see items that belonged to aerosmith ,  metallica ,  michael jackson ,  joan jett ,  the stones ,  etc was awesome !  might not go back again unless they add more items between now and then but would definitely bring my kids to show them as time goes on . 
__label__5 this place just made me downright happy !   while i like music ,  i certainly don ' t consider myself a connoisseur .   but the exhibits are so well done ,  the inductees video energetic and the history comes to life ,  so much so i actually got emotional at times !   i almost opted to "pass" since it wasn ' t on my must-see list .  .  . wow am i glad i didn ' t miss it !   if you have 5 hours to spend here ,  it will be well worth the time and it will fly by .   great spot ,  wonderfully entertaining ! 
__label__4 my mom and i ended up renting here ,  because dollar decided to close and cancel our reservation without letting us know .  the worker here actually overheard our conversation with a dollar employee on the phone and stayed open to help us out .  alamo was very efficient and had nice ,  clean cars ,  along with friendly ,  helpful employees .  i ' d definitely choose this place over dollar . 
__label__5 fast counter service ,  great rental vehicle .  i forgot my expensive polaroid sunglasses in the glove box of the vehicle .  patty from lost+found department recovered my sunglasses and promptly  sent it via fedex on my request .  thanks a lot patty ! 
__label__5 fast service ,  great one way rate ,  and a very nice vehicle .   what more could you want ? 
__label__1 never again !  !  !  we had the most rude lady check us in on 9 / 25 / 2015 .  we had reserved our car online due to the low rate through priceline .  the lady at the counter was so unbelievably rude .  she had the worst attitude and tone of voice and completely ruined this experience for us .  i looked over the counter to see if she was wearing a name tag and of course she wasn ' t  ( how convenient )   .  i was so upset by this .  also- our car was dirty .  upon getting into the vehicle we noticed that there was trash in the backseat .  before driving off we told the lady who was at the gate  ( she was much nicer )  .  the only good thing was that the car was fuel efficient and got us where we needed to go .  while the car was idling it sounded a little "rough" and my husband said it sounded like it needed an oil change .  return was quick & easy .  i was glad we did not encounter the lady at the check-in counter .  i am applaud at her lack of customer service skills .  we were exhausted from our travel across country ,  the least she could have done was been a little nicer . 
__label__2 probably should have looked up the reviews for this place first .   4th street bar and grill seems like a pretty cool place to hang out .   there is a medium-sized bowling alley in addition to the restaurant and it looks like they have pretty good happy hour specials .   the food and service ,  however ,  is lacking .   we walked over here on a friday night looking for some food after a 6+ hour drive into cleveland .   we were promptly seated ,  but then waited about 10 minutes before our waiter came over to take our orders .   it was like that for the rest of our meal too - despite the place being mostly empty ,  our waiter was not around much to refill waters either .   if you do end up eating here i would recommend avoiding the pizza .   i don ' t remember the name of one i ordered ,  but it came with spinach ,  olives ,  onions and  ( i think )  mushrooms .   the toppings were fresh ,  but the crust was pretty terrible .   it was thin and soggy ,  and predictably fell apart when you tried to pick it up .   or maybe it had holes in it to begin with ,  it was kind of hard to tell .     my girlfriend ordered the "terminal tower" sandwich ,  which was decent .   it was a pork burger ,  with a perogie ,  bacon and cheese ,  served on a pretzel bun and accompanied by passable dinner fries .   the bottom bun kind of got lost in the mass of fillings ,  but interesting combination of ingredients and overall a pretty good taste . 
__label__5 i thought this place was pretty awesome .  you can literally spend a whole day there without noticing it .  it was a good education museum i would say ,  and i learned so much about the history of guitar and rock and roll .  did you know that "rock and roll" used to be a bad word ,  referring to inappropriateness  ( related to sexuality )  ?  yeah i found it out there .  they also have a pretty big theater where you can watch a movie of the past 100 year history of rock and roll .  my friends from chicago really enjoyed it .  and there ' s a reason why cleveland is called rock and roll city ,  right ?  ; ) 
__label__5 blown away !  this museum is killer .   they rotate feature exhibits and have great sound experiences .   the hendrix section alone is worth half a day .   if you like music ,  even if rock isn ' t your thing ,  i can ' t overstate how muchi recommend that you see the  rock hall .   it ' s about the only "must-do" in cleveland ,  unless you have a sports allegiance to feed .   plan for at least a few hours ,  it ' s better to set aside all day .   if i lived here ,  i ' d come a couple of times a year . 
__label__5 i can ' t believe i had to add this business place to yelp .   is rock dead ?    ( don ' t answer that )   i ' m a sucker for museums .   i ' m a huge sucker for music nostalgia .   hand written lyrics on scratch paper ,  original pressing records ,  buddy holly ' s glasses ,  stage costumes .  .  .  i love that shit .   some of the coolest things i saw were rejection letters from record exec ' s written to u2  ( and i don ' t even like u2 )  ,  drawings / poems by john lennon ,  the "blank generation" exhibit  ( right up my alley )  ,  bon jovi ' s new jersey coat  ( brought me way back )  ,  and jeff beck ' s 8 string guitar .   i always hate it when items are temporarily missing from an exhibit for restoration .   i feel like i ' m missing out ,  even if i don ' t know what it is .   there were a handful of items that weren ' t there .  .  .  i think that ' s the only complaint i have .   we walked to the museum in the snow ,  and it didn ' t even bother me because i was so excited to get there .   we took a cab back to the hotel ,  tho .  .  .  and it was probably the best cab drive i ' ve ever had .   the driver was an old man chit chatting away ,  giving us a mini tour of downtown cleveland on our way back to the hotel .   he told us about all the buildings ,  lake erie ,  and how the downtown was turned into new york for a month so they can film 3 minutes of spiderman 3 .   i love rock and roll  ( ok ,  i stole that one )  ,  and i love the hall of fame and museum . 
__label__5 the rock and roll hall of fame is a great place for music lovers of any genre .  it ' s so interesting to walk throughout the five floors ,  and each level brings a new kind of life to the history found on the walls .  i would definitely recommend checking out the videos on the fourth floor ,  they ' re extremely informational and really help to bring the entire place together . 
__label__5 i was not prepared for what i would see in this place .    i would love to return and spend more time looking and reading and learning .     artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first recording .   influence and significance of contributions are also considered .   michael jackson costumes ,  sunglasses ,  shoes and grammy were just beyond .     hand written notes ,  costumes of various artists ,  and context--such as the resistance given to rock and roll--is imperative in understanding the influence on different artists .   the gift shop is super with a lot of gifts .   .   .   i only wish the staff dressed up like some of the artists ,  lol .   i mean ,  how fun is that ? 
__label__5 still wiping the drool from my mouth .  the guitar collection is outstanding .  handwritten lyrics ,  famous clothing .  it ' s a musician ' s dream .  wishing some other artists were "in the club" but ,  politics happen .  i ' m thankful the rock hall is here in cleveland ! 
__label__3 i really liked the beatles and chicago displays !  the only thing is i felt like the flow and the genres and decades are all mixed together .  outside of that lower level which is the best part ,   the rest is ok . 
__label__5 i had been super excited about going to cleveland ,  specifically because i wanted to be able to see the rock and roll hall of fame .  even so ,  part of me was kind of skeptical .  it ' s just a museum ,  right ?  how cool can it be ?  super cool .  no ,  really .  i fangirled my heart out there and only wish i could have stayed for longer .    so apparently the museum is open pretty late on wednesdays ,  which is great .  there were a lot of people there ,  especially clumped on that first floor of the museum ,  but for the most part ,  i could move around relatively freely without crowds .  it made me happy .    the museum really is an amazing experience for any music fan .  from the incredible history of music that the museum covers to the totally legit memorabilia collection ,  to the les paul exhibit ,  everything about this museum was so .  much .  fun .  i squeed over david bowie stuff .  i squeed over beatles stuff .  hell ,  i squeed about memorabilia for musicians that i ' m not even that big of a fan of .  it hadn ' t hit me how rich of a history the world of rock music really has until you ' re there .  it ' s amazing .  also ,  they have flava flav ' s clock ,  so there ' s that .    i also played a fun game there .  i have notoriously awful handwriting ,  so i played a fun game where i would compare these famous musicians '  handwriting to my own .  keeping in mind how many of these artists spent so much time hopped up on drugs ,  i ' m embarrassed to report back that i found maybe one set of lyrics written in worse writing than mine .    actually ,  my other favorite part of the museum was the hall of fame room where they run through clips of each year ' s inductees .  i spent a good forty minutes in there and would have spent more time had it not been for the fact that we were nearing closing time .    so ,  if you are in cleveland ,  make the trip out to the rock and roll hall of fame .  it ' s so worth it for any music fan . 
__label__5 i went to the rock and roll hall of fame with an ole college friend visiting from south carolina .  he use to travel around in the summer and sell merchandise at the stadiums for big bands .  well ,  he went wild and really enjoyed looking and reading  ( all )  the memorabilia in front of us !  we must of spent 7 . 5 hours in there until we were hungry .  we could have dined at the new cafe there lakeside ,  but i wanted to show him more of cleveland .  it ' s worth the admission ,  they even have a floor dedicated to the president ' s and how music  influenced politics and the wars ,  plus campaign songs .  i saw bill clinton ' s saxophone !  who knew .  .  . 
__label__4 i ' ve lived in cleveland pretty much my whole life ,  and i hadn ' t been to the rock hall until about 2 months ago .   it was amazing .   all of that history and culture under one roof .   highlights for me were mama cass ' s pink sparkly dress and all of the janis joplin stuff . 
__label__5 amazing museum .   a historical trip through musical memorabilia .   the beatles and rolling stone exhibit is phenomenal .   the trip down technology memory lane was terrific .   brought back memories of watching my dad with real-to-real recorders in our basement .   loved the cubbies where you can listen to music .   the food choices aren ' t bad either .   loved the movie theater showing the annual inductions into the hall of fame .   would go every year ! 
__label__5 such a wonderful experience to learn about the past and present of rock n roll .  you will definitely loose track of time learning about the history . 
__label__4 visiting ohio for the first time ,  we just had to visit the museum !  purchased tickets off their site using my aaa member discount and only paid $17 per ticket .  good deal !  we parked at a nearby lot by the water for $8 .   the staff working there is very friendly and i hardly noticed them as we went through the museum .  there were a few classes of kids running amok ,  so i kinda wished they regulated on that more .   the museum covers all genres and showcased all kinds of musical gems such as instruments ,  costumes ,  souvenirs ,  programs and lyric books .  being only 2 feet away from mj ' s costume for the "thriller" video was just astounding .  i also enjoyed looking at the original written lyrics to various songs by various artists .  who knew aerosmith ' s "walk this way" was so dirty ?   definitely a fun and educational place for music buffs .  they covered so much ,  yet not enough .  if you haven ' t been ,  go ! 
__label__5 very sweet people !  the food was great !  we had arroz con gandules ,  plie1tanos ,  mofongo con shrimp ,  y dominican fried chicken .  it was so good and flavorful . 
__label__4 the stewed chicken was a hearty flavorful meal served with beans & rice .  find and aromatic memories of this dish .  yes ,   i would order it again though it was a bit more  ( $12 )  than i normally pay for lunch .  that said ,  the food here is excellent and the portions are large so come to eat a lot or come prepared to share it or take some home .  the selection of tropical drinks is also good .   all in all ,  a bit like a quick vacation to the tropics ,  right here in the cle !  ! 
__label__5 amazing food .  i ordered their talipia which was out of this world .  i am puerto rican so i know what good pr / dr food is !  service was lovely ,  local ,  made from scratch food !  !  hands down would visit again next time i ' m in cleveland .  this place does pr food right !  !  !  about 12 dollars a plate but with the amount of food they give you ,  its worth it . 
__label__4 the people here at this shop can be very hit or miss .   many of them are awkward but charmingly introverted .   however ,  they were helpful and were very patient with me and my friend .   we tried on a bunch of stuff and i left with a crop top and a wire headband  ( which are lovely !  ) 
__label__4 you know what ?  eff it .  .  .  i ' m bumping american apparel up to 4 stars because even though they may not take returns ,  they store your info to make exchanging a snap--even if you forgot the receipt .    ahem .  .  .  i may or may not have done this .    also ,  the girls  ( and today a nice gentlemen )  who work here help me so much !  they are super thoughtful in their opinions and don ' t mind me asking for help every five minutes .  and they help me make decisions when i model all my outfits .  yes ,  me likey .  alot .    oh ,  and sure--be creeped out by the models ,  mannequins ,  whatever .  but you know what i think is more creepy ?  sweatshops ,  un-fair trade and plain-jane ,  close-minded attitudes .  at least when i shop here i know i ' m 1 )  buying american and fairly 2 )  supporting a company that supports equality and being yourself-even if other people find your metallic unitard unusual .  i say let it fly ! 
__label__5 i didn ' t stay at the hotel but i did come here for a cd release at the alex theatre and had a meal here .  wow - this place is beautiful .  super classy .  i was blown away with how elegant and beautiful it was inside . 
__label__1 our "reserved room" is really small ,  claims to fit 4 people .  .  def would not .  .  not to mention that the shower is in the middle of the room .  .  there is no privacy .  looks like a shower in the morning is not happening with my friend and brother in law in the same room .  def not happy with this room
__label__2 i stayed in this hotel for 4 weeks .  chris at the front desk was so nice and helpful .  he always had smile on his face and was very accommodating .   also ,  the person that help you carry your bags to your rooms  ( i think his name was damian ?  )  was super nice ,  too .  on the other hand ,  the other front desk guy  ( i didn ' t even bother to remember his name )  was so rude and nasty .  one time ,  i asked him to break $20 bill because of the valet ,  he didn ' t say anything  ( not even "ok" or "sure" )  ,  went in the back ,  came back and just threw the change on the desk .  i didn ' t even hear one word from him .  i never saw him with a smile in that 4 long weeks .  as this hotel is marriott group ,  don ' t they tell front desk employees to put fake smiles on their face even bad days ?  ?  !  !  !  on fridays and saturdays ,  some party people check in to have parties in the rooms .  sometimes i heard screams and loud noises at 2 in the morning .  so if you are thinking about staying here with your kids on a weekend ,  i would cancel it and stay in another hotel .    no coffee machine in the room .  either room service or 1st floor lobby coffee service from 5am to 9am . 
__label__3 cool design and super trendy; however i am only rating it three stars because of the weird room layout .  the shower is in the middle of the room instead of in the bathroom .  and there is no desk to work at in the room ,  which is a bit of a hassle if you ' re traveling for business .  i would stay here again for a couples weekend but not alone or with friends .  service was friendly and the main restaurant was decent for breakfast .  the fitness center is located on the floor above the lobby but there are not any guestrooms on that floor and the door was not locked  ( there was a pad to swipe your guest room key but it wasn ' t functioning and the door was open so hopefully they can get that fixed )  ,  which made me a little bit nervous being in there alone . 
__label__3 fun atmosphere  /  not well thought out ergonomically .  no coffee maker in the rooms ,  no robes - for the price these should come standard .  not kid-friendly . 
__label__5 if i could give my stay at the metropolitan 6 stars i would !  i ' m not sure i have ever stayed at a hotel in my life i would say was worth the money ,  but this hotel definitely was !  my wife and i were looking for a one-night get away at a local hotel ,  but never expected it to be so amazing .  as soon as you walk in the front door ,  you feel like you ' re entering a new world of modern ,  chic ,  elegance .  i think the staff at the front desk saw my wife and i stop and stare at our surroundings ,  so came and helped us check in with ease .    we immediately felt special and valued .  it ' s impossible to downplay how much care was put in to every detail of this hotel .  they could easily charge admission ,  just to walk around and explore the artistry of every wall .  i could talk about how cool the automatic elevators were also ,  but i ' ll move on .  just for perspective ,  we felt all this before ever even reaching our room !    as we entered our hotel room we immediately said ,  "wow ! " it ' s not that it was the largest room we had ever stayed in ,  but it was by far the nicest .  it ' s clear the passion to detail and ambience they put into the entrance and hallways ,  continued into our room .  there were no cheap ,  cut corners here .  i would describe most hotel rooms ,  even the nice ones as functional ,  nice ,  or might comment on how big they were .  but ,  this room felt sexy ,  cozy ,  plush ,  and opulent .  the room made my wife and i feel like we wanted to immediately relax ,  but it also gave us a vibe that we wanted to go out for a night on the town .     after unpacking ,  we explored the movie room they have ,  and the rooftop bar ,  azure .  every part of this hotel was created with passion ,  excellence ,  with a little bit of sexiness .  if you ' re coming in town for a weekend ,  or just looking to get away with your loved one ,  or family ,  i could not recommend this hotel enough .    on top of all that ,  this hotel has such an amazing location .  progressive field ,  the q ,  and the casino are right down the street in one direction .  east 4th street ,  which is filled with restaurants is in another direction  ( that ' s where my wife and i went )  .  the theater district is right down the street in a third direction .  although we ' re locals ,  i don ' t think my wife and i had ever had such a fun time in downtown cleveland .  oh ,  and we explored the amazing bank-turned heinen ' s grocery store next door .  that may sound weird ,  but it ' s amazing and worth exploring too !    my only feedbacks is ,  it would have been nice if there were a few more papers around our bed ,  introducing us to azure ,  and giving us a list of all the amazing cleveland things we could explore during our stay . 
__label__2 disappointed .   great reputation ,  but i found the food to be disappointing .  very bland and under seasoned .  i had the pork chop with apple chutney .  it was like applesauce on a bland chop .  also sampled the mahi mahi .  very bland .  service was only ok .  half the wedding was done eating before all the tables had been served
__label__4 amid a delightful neighborhood filled with nice sit-down restaurants lies presti ' s .  this is the holy grail of "take a number and wait in line" .   family run ,  presti ' s offers a full range of baked goods ,  italian fare ,  espresso drinks ,  and even gelato !  they always have different foods made fresh in the display ripe for the ordering .  if the crowds are any indication of popularity ,  then they might be regina george without the attitude .    my only advice is get there early unless you want a long line ! 
__label__4 awesome bakery in little italy .  after dinner at maxi ' s ,  we came here for dessert and it was jammed packed .  when i got our ticket ,  we were number 69 and they were at number 35 .  however ,  we didn ' t need to wait too long .  just a little patience !  it was worth the wait .  we got several desserts to share - cannolis ,  two slices of tiramisu ,  a slice of sorrentina  ( hazelnut cake )  ,  a slice of german chocolate cake ,  and a slice of cherry cheesecake .  everything was moist and delicious .  definitely coming back here again to try their cassata cake ! 
__label__3 ok ,  i am sure you are surprised to be seeing only 3 stars ,  but let me clarify .  there stuff is downright yummy !   however ,  their service is horrible .  .  . they are ridiculously slow and rude .  additionally ,  what ' s with the crazy hours ?  they close way too early .  at the end of the day the yummy factor is outweighed by all the other factors so it will be a long while before i go back . 
__label__5 as i write this review ,  i must preface this by stating that my rating is based solely off my experiences eating their pastries and baked goods--i have yet to dabble in their lunch .    presti ' s has become my go-to in terms of sweet treats ,  whether it ' s ordering a cassata cake for a family party ,  getting ample amounts of cannoli ' s to-go ,  or getting a few loaves of fresh bread ,  presti ' s has yet to fail me .  everything i ' ve had is incredibly fresh ,  loaded in flavor ,  and all at an affordable price .    while the wait may be intimidating with the old-fashioned number dispenser ,  the employees are so accustomed to the rush that they truly handle the bustle in a consistently steady manner .    i always decline getting a dessert at one of the many restaurant ' s down the street because of my adoration of presti ' s bakery .  to all of my sweet tooth friends ,  if you haven ' t stopped at presti ' s you truly are missing out . 
__label__4 thank god for bakeries like presti ' s and corbo ' s !   i might not be able to survive living in cleveland if not for these two places .   i was never a fan of cannoli ' s and neither places have converted me .   but everything else is great !   presti ' s has a nice gelato section and savory foods section as well .   their bread selection is pretty good too ,  but i definitely go for the coconut chocolate cake and the sfogliatelle .   they have a massive cream puff as well - largest cream puff i ' ve ever seen .   also ,  i never cared for tiramisu ,  but their ' s is quite airy and smooth with a good amount of chocolate coating and a not too overwhelming rum flavor .   the cookies are pretty decent .     skip the coffee !    ( they can ' t be good at everything )   don ' t forget to take a number  ( red dispenser is on the pillar on your left ,  right when you walk in the door )  .   i didn ' t know the first time and after figuring out what i wanted ,  i realized i had to take a number and wait all over again . 
__label__4 when i discover a city has a little italy neighborhood ,  my number one priority is to get my hands on a cannoli .  whether it ' s boston ,   baltimore ,  or cleveland ,  it ' s an absolute must  ( this is serious business people )  .    cleveland ' s little italy is a lively place on saturday night ,  so we had to fight for a parking spot and a place in line at presti ' s .  luckily there were plenty of employees to help us out and make it a fun experience .  even though it was a bit of a hassle ,  that crunch of the pastry and sweet creamy ricotta was totally worth it !  !  ! 
__label__5 always love having evening dessert here visiting from san diego .  i was hoping to get a slice of cassata cake but this easter holiday weekend ,  the desserts were a bit limited and focused on easter cakes and cookies .  so ,  no cassata cake !   however ,  i went with option b which is always consistently satisfying .  .  . a cannoli and a coffee !  !  !  yum !  !  !  to be honest ,  you cannot go wrong with any of the dessert offerings .  try the cannoli cake .  .  . 
__label__4 presti ' s offers a great assortment of cookies and pastries .   we tried their chocolate covered cannolis ,  various cookies ,  and cassata cake .   all were very fresh and tasted great .   the cassata cake was so moist that it blended nicely with the layers of custard inside .   our only disappointment was the selection and quality of the gelato .   we ' ve had better in the bay area . 
__label__5 best .  cannolo .  ever .  i have literally never eaten a better one .  and i ' ve had them from the famous mike ' s pastry in boston ' s north end ,  as well as modern ,  which some think is better .  both pale in comparison to presti ' s !  !  ! 
__label__5 great cannoli and coffee .   excellent atmosphere for a casual cup of joe with some friends .     i didn ' t have time to get the breakfast sandwich but needless to say they look amazing and they are about as big as your head .   the sausage on them looks much more substantial than your usual mcmuffin .   if i had to place bets it was probably procured from a local butcher .   if i had more time i would have gotten one .   finally ,  this is the place to take your kids if you want to spoil them with a real cookie .   they have your traditional italian anise cookies right alongside chocolate chip and m&m cookies that are about the size of a personal pizza . 
__label__4 cute ,  very cute .  cute little place in the middle of little italy .   my friend and i were on the search for dessert after having a nice dinner  ( and i can ' t help it ,  i ' m addicted to sugar )  .  he suggested presti ' s .  .  . so sure ,  why not ,  off we went .    i walked in and was surprised at the assortment of pastries and food that welcomed you ,  all sitting in their nice little glass cases .  we ordered a tiramisu to split- i got coffee to pair ,  him the hot chocolate ,  and sat down and enjoyed our dessert .  it was a good tiramisu- one of my faves !  he even got me to grab a spinach focaccia  ( or whatever it is .  . one of those bread pockets filled with spinach and cheese ?  )  out the door for my lunch the following day .  .  . and man ,  that ' s good .   i highly recommend that .  .  .   overall though ,  cute little bakery / cafe in little italy that ' s worth taking a stop at if you ' re in the area . 
__label__3 great cannoli and sfogliatelle but what self respecting italian bakery has never heard of zeppole otherwise known as st joseph ' s day cakes .   and they call themselves italian ?  ?  ? 
__label__5 can i just say i love this place ?  every time i am in the area ,  i need to go there to get some tiramisu .  wide selection ,  reasonable prices ,  get a table next to the full glass windows and enjoy little italy to the fullest .    ps - the one thing that is a bit annoying is that there ' s a minimum purchase amount you need to make before you can use your credit card .  i think the amount is 5$ .  .  . but cannot remember for sure . 
__label__4 i am the least likely person to review an italian bakery .  i have a short list of ingredients i simply find intolerable .  italian bakers use anise ,  rum flavoring ,  almond flavoring ,  ricotta and citrons by the handful .  if any one of these comes near me i lose my appetite .  i have thrown out entire cakes when i detected rum flavor .  canoli stay away from my door ,  almond biscotti keep away from me .    presti ' s attracts a wide circle of fans .  uh nurses as well as patients and their families come here .  cwru students and faculty sit next to one another .  people from all over as well as neighborhood residents sip coffee or bite into pizza .  it is not possible to label presti ' s as a hangout for any subgroup .  it successfully caters to the many who come to the circle and the hill .    the bread ,  bakery and pizza offer an abundance of choices to satisfy anyone .  the prepared dishes ranging from simple sub sandwiches to chicken picatta are as good as any on the hill .  since this is an italian establishment gelato and expresso are available .    this is a busy place .  this is a happy place .  sitting here you are glad some of cleveland survives .  you can imagine you are in the past ,  or in a movie ,  or in some other place .  luckily you are on mayfield hill and can return . 
__label__5 with chinese food everybody has there favorite spot .  i judge a spot the most popular dishes .  like ,  egg rolls ,  fried rice and orange chicken .  when i tell this place is amazing ,  boy ,  it ' s finger licking good ! 
__label__3 easy enough to locate and navigate ,  the tower city rta station is completely underground .  it ' s in the center and underneath a small shopping center with clothing ,  food and coffee vendors about .  decent enough signage to find your way down to the tracks area ,  though i ' m glad that i wasn ' t trying to find my way out the first time i used the station .  it ' s not completely easy to get from the tracks to the right part of the tower city building .   on a weekend without the usual heavy traffic ,  the folks hanging around seemed a little sketchy .  but if you keep moving along and ignore the panhandler or two ,  you ' ll be fine . 
__label__5 this place is like the balsamic reduction of all the quality record stores i ' ve been to in my life .  they always have what i ' m looking for ,  unless i ' m looking for gyros .  or gin .  or quality term life insurance .  if i had more disposable income ,  i would spend it here . 
__label__1 the staff ?  well ,  they ' re not all that bloody friendly .  .  . the selection ?  if you read pitchfork and have no taste ,  you ' ll loose yr nut .  otherwise ,  try amazon .  or just listen to those old cle hc recs you still pretend are good . 
__label__5 for the past two years i have suffered from chronic lower back pain .  at times ,  it would be so bad that i would have difficulty walking for prolonged periods of time . ia0  i have seen other chiropractors ,  however ,  none managed to resolve the issue; i would leave appointments with the pain subsided ,  only to have it resurface in a half hour or so .  not to mention ,  appointments were often rushed through and the quality of care poor .   a friend of mine referred me to dr .  alberty ,  and thanks to him ,  my lower back issue has been resolved - i feel like a brand new person !  he has such a keen ability to diagnose and treat; he is very thorough during his appointments; and ,  he provides quality service .  for those looking for a great chiropractor ,  i highly recommend ! 
__label__4 this place is the reason i am never late for my flight  i always arrive at the airport early so i could stop by here  ( even though it ' s so damn far away from my gate )  ,  enjoy a tall glass of dortmunder and maybe something to eat before flying back to lga .  it puts me in a happy place   servers / bartenders here are all very nice and helping .    only thing is food is really mediocre .  i ' ve gotten the pierogi and brats as well as the old world burger .  pierogi and brats were very very bland .  the old world burger was just too saucy ,  and the bread to dense .  whatever .  you don ' t come here for a 5 star meal ,  it ' s an airport .  you come here to have a great glass of beer and you can ' t go wrong with great lakes  food: b atmosphere: b+ service: b-
__label__5 one of the best beers in cleveland .  food amazing ,  pricey . 
__label__4 one of my favorite local breakfast places .  skip the chain restaurants and come here .  good selection of food ,  good prices and fast service .  try the "two for the money" or "western skillet"
__label__4 always the same .  good ol '  white castle .   i live in california now ,  but when i go back for a visit ,  visiting this place is a must . 
__label__3 indian flame delivers to uh which makes it great for uh employees wanting indian food .   the aloo gobi ,  chicken tikka masala ,  naan and paneer tikka masala are all good but probably about average for indian food in cleveland .   their lunch buffet is very affordable and often serves the classics .   the food is pretty mild so its a good place for people new to indian cuisine . 
__label__4 i started last month going to a different indian restaurant lunch buffet every saturday since the buffet food gives an idea of the restaurants cuisine close enough to the a la carte menu in my opinion so i started to look .  this was my first stop and it may not be my last but it also could have been .  the restaurant itself is at the end of the uptown region of university circle around case western reserve university almost to the other side of the tracks; east cleveland .  the restaurant is small ,  busy and vibrant ,  but small .  there were not many young people there ,  however this was before case begun again and maybe during the school year; the students frequent .  i cannot say for sure because when i was an undergrad i ate out once a month maybe so idk maybe they are more well off ,  i digress .  the waiting staff was not really paying that close of attention to who was coming in and out .  woe to me ,  but i have a nut allergy and indian cuisine certainly uses nuts so i have to be that person and ask .  the waiting staff had no clue which had nuts and what did not .  that was rather annoying until finally someone came from the back and told me what had nuts and what did not .  the first time i asked ,  the waiter i guess thought that i was only allergic to peanuts and told me those which my allergy is much worse for tree nuts so i am glad i asked again but this time said cashews ,  almonds ,  etc .  anyways; the food was the typical selection of chicken tikka ,  another creamy chicken dish with nuts that i did not devour ,  naan ,  samosa ,  gulab jamun ,  vegetable dishes ,  etc .  it was tight fitting and there was a restroom but there was a constant line so it was not the easiest but not as bad as others .  the spice was not bad at all and even children would enjoy the food since it did win in the flavor department ,  it was very good food and not super heavy which is a good thing .  price was gear as well ,  i believe it was $8 . 99
__label__2 haven ' t even gotten my food yet and the place is already pretty shitty and poorly run .   ok so the food has arrived .  .  .  .  .  it ' s good ,  small portions i guess but still pretty good- nothing crazy about it but acceptable by my standards .  while not my favorite indian place in the city ,  actually maybe my least favorite ,  it gets the job done .   oh ,  and the place is filthy
__label__4 cozy ,  tasty ,  inexpensive .  nice place .  you will have to know basically all the food that is there .  you don ' t know what you are eating .  everything is either labeled "veg" or "non-veg"  .  this is not the place for folks who don ' t like spicy food .  if you like spicy food this is the place for you .  otherwise ,  everything was amazing .  if you eat there ,  have the non-veg chicken .  it is reddish and really good .  there is also the veg green sauce you don ' t want to miss out on .  and the non-veg red sauce with bits of chicken inside that is the best food ever .  the naan there is really good !  it will calm down your mouth if it is too spicy .  eat a lot of the naan if you go there but don ' t like spicy food .  this place is amazing and i highly recommend it . 
__label__5 what an excellent place to eat that is fast ,  down to earth ,  and full of good food--everything that an indian restaurant should be .  try their butter chicken which is quite good . 
__label__1 just called for delivery service .   they apparently claim to deliver however ,  15 minutes away is too far to travel .   how ridiculous is that ?   not much you can say for food that you can ' t even eat .   but poor service .   wow .   how the hell is a 15 minute drive too far to deliver ?   disappointed is not the word .   clearly the quick tip for this place is not to order delivery because they really don ' t deliver . 
__label__5 in my humble opinion this is the best spot to satisfy your indian cuisine cravings .  the food is continuously delicious .  i have enjoyed everything i ' ve tried in their menu  ( i ' m always trying new things )  .  everything is so freaking flavorful .  the weekend lunch buffet is very good quality food for your buck .  enjoy ! 
__label__3 i ' m no expert on indian food ,  but this was pretty tasty .  i had chilli chicken and ordered it medium spiced since i knew there were supposed to be peppers in the dish in the first place .  my mouth was appropriately burning when i finished eating and i was delighted because i love spicy food .    my boyfriend got goat curry .  i was scared because i ' ve never had goat ,  so i tried it and it was fantastic .  melt in your mouth delicious and the curry was superb .  i would agree with habby ,  though .  the service was strange ,  though we didn ' t really have any trouble . 
__label__1 avoid the team who works here at 5 on mondays !  shockingly bad service .  we showed up at 4:59 ,  the time at which you would expect them to be opening for dinner ,  and asked if they were open .  one employee was sitting in a booth with his feet up ,  shoes off  ( on the table )  ,  and listening to music while the other simply sat in darkness .  our table was wordlessly cleared as the hostess glared at us .  we felt uncomfortable .  then ,  our menus were practically tossed at us ,  again wordlessly ,  as she retreated to the kitchen .  when she returned ,  we asked if we had come too early ,  and ,  after glaring at us for roughly three seconds ,  she snapped that ,  no ,  we were actually right on time .   i ' ve never felt so unwelcome .  our party was large and the tip would have been sizable ,  but we couldn ' t bring ourselves to accept that attitude .  we left and will never eat there again . 
__label__5 i love this place !  it ' s great to finally  have a good indian restaurant on case western campus .    the food is less expensive relative to other indian restaurants of cleveland because they give free naan or rice with each dish .  the serving size of the chicken buryani is great too .  i especially like their authentic bhel puri .  overall ,  i eat here pretty regularly . 
__label__5 my favorite indian restaurant in the cleveland  area !  festive and colorful decor and outstanding food  !  flakey naan and flavorful sauces  .  spiced and delicate rice ! 
__label__4 now this was a fun place to hang out on a sunny father ' s day in cleveland !   casual beach umbrella-topped picnic tables studded the sandy ,  grassy area of the marina at whiskey island .   casually-clad  ( some shirtless dudes !  : -  )  )  )  )  lined up at the shed for food and there was a separate line for drinks - full bar and some quite nice craft beers on tap and in bottles .   i guess i should mention this is kind of a beach bar - there was a building ,  but it all happens outdoors !   love that .   we ordered bloody mary ' s ,  a shandy and a bud light lime while the hubby waited in the food line for smoked wings .   we took all our goodies over to a table and enjoyed some of the best smoked wings i ' ve ever had while we watched lots of dogs with their owners interacting with a slew of other dogs and owners - pugs ,  chiuauas ,  boston terriers ,  labs ,  shelties .  .  . to name just a few .   good boat-watching ,  too ,  as sailbots and cigarette boats alike pulled in and out as we enjoyed the sun .     good old-fashioned 60 ' s and 70 ' s rock and roll played in the background and as we were leaving ,  a live band showed up to entertain the night away .   wish we could have stayed .   we will be back ! 
__label__4 this is a great place to grab a beer after a volleyball game or watch some live music .   it stinks that everyone has discovered this little gem this summer - weekend volume has been crazy !  !   the food is better than your average bar food but it could use some additional options .   but you really aren ' t here for the food ,   you are here to enjoy the few months of nice weather in cleveland !  !   overall ,  cleveland has done a poor ,  poor job on capitalizing it ' s lakefront location and whiskey island is just about the only place near downtown that you can go and relax by the lake !  ! 
__label__4 i ' ve been going to common grounds for years and years .    the raspberry bitch kiss is by far one of my favorite drinks .  everything they make is tasty but ,  the bitch kiss is the best !  some people are all about the ambiance of a place and some people are all about the product being served .  if you ' ve read my reviews .  you ' d know ,  i don ' t really give a shit an out the majority of places .   i cate about the service !  i cate about the food / drinks some of my most favorite places have been hole in the walls .  common grounds is that hole in the wall .   it ' s dark ,  there is free wifi and there is also old school video games .   oh yes ,  old school video games that are set up .  the entire place is painted black and purple .  it isn ' t pretty ,  but it ' s clean .   the drinks are always incredible and the barista is awesome !  ! 
__label__5 went there thanks to groupon .  loved it .  decor very classy ,  service very attentive and friendly---and not just another steakhouse .  prime rib was terrific .  and the place is quiet unlike a number of other places in town .  could actually hold a conversation .  can ' t wait to go back . 
__label__4 i was referred to prime rib steakhouse by the groupon deal online .  the atmosphere and decor is pretty sweet .  menu offers generous cuts of prime rib and whatever sides i . e .  baked potato ,  corn ,  creamed spinach .  depending on your appetite and how well you ' re doing in life ,  you can add an additional lobster tail with your cut .   the whole experience at prime rib steakhouse is definitely cool .  they make your salad at the table by spinning a salad bowl in an ice bowl and tossing all the ingredients together .  everyone is excited to see the meat carver roll through with his fancy metallic cart .  the portions are very generous .  i had some trouble with the cleveland cut .  .  .  excuse me .  with every meal ,  you get a side of mashed potatoes and yorkshire pudding .  i do recommend sharing an extra side of vegetables just to balance out yourself .    it was a fun experience at prime rib steakhouse and i definitely recommend all the cleveland locals to go out and try it sometime . 
__label__5 great restaurant .  amazing friendly service .  excellent food .  have been three times .  i would highly recommend it .  discover this great yet to be discovered gem .  easy to get a table .  great atmosphere and music . 
__label__3 i ' m torn between giving prime rib steakhouse three and four stars and went with three because while i had a good experience and would recommend it ,  i ' m not sure that i would go again .   my initial thought upon entering was that i liked the deep red walls .   elegant ,  but hip .   i also noticed the funky / modern lighting above the bar area .   then ,  i noticed the very traditional and quaint lighting just across the room ,  above the main seating area .   the fact that the styles of lights clashed so much might not bother most people ,  but i couldn ' t get over it .   i think they should take out the more traditional little lamps and replace them with similarly modern lighting to uniform the place .     i went with my boyfriend .   he was very excited about his prime rib .  .  . i had never ordered prime rib before !   the first part of our meal was bread and butter ,  no complains there .   i ordered a signature martini and he had a glass of zinfandel .   i liked my martini  ( the pink orchid )  but should have gone with wine to better accompany the steak ,  especially since i was drinking it throughout the course of meal as it was a bit on the sweet side ,  even for the drink ' s description .    the meal: the spinning salad bowl is totally unnecessary--a show that does not impress .   our server forgot her salad tossers which also "ruined the show"  ( her words )  .   we were given chilled salad forks and salad plates straight from the freezer .   do people really care that their salad is getting warm ?   because i am a person with sensitive teeth anyway ,  these little touches had the opposite effect on me--i could barely eat my salad--it was way too cold !     the prime rib-mobile  ( my boyfriend ' s term )  came out after our salads and we watched the chef carve our cuts .   i had the smallest option ,  the california cut ,  and my boyfriend had one of the larger ones .   the prime rib-mobile served our steaks and our sides and rolled away .     the verdict on the prime rib: good !   flavorful .   i enjoyed it ,  but i am not a huge steak eater in general and only ate about half of my cut  ( which was the one for "lighter appetites" to begin with )  .   when the server came to take our plates ,  she pointed at it with both hands and said "what happened ?  !   something went wrong ? "  i ' m sure it ' s rare that people come to this place and don ' t finish most of their plates ,  but it ' s not like i barely touched it ,  and if i hadn ' t found what she said so funny ,  i would have found it awkward .   i told her that i was saving room for dessert .    ( another reason i was probably unique in this restaurant !  )   for dessert we shared the chocolate cake ,  which they should advertise as a chocolate torte-lava cake .   it came with ice cream and strawberries and was a very good ending .   we finished it all even though we were both quite full .     near the end of our meal ,  the prime rib-mobile got wheeled down the steps directly behind us by the chef ,  who apologized for the noise in advance .   clunk clunk clunk clunk clunk .  .  .  . you ' d think they could wait until everyone leaves to move the kitchen-on-wheels out of the way ?     the servers were nice ,  the food was good ,  and the ambiance pleasant as well ,  though a little mis-matched !   we didn ' t even realize that it was restaurant week .   they had a good deal but there weren ' t many people in the restaurant taking advantage of it--there were probably 9 people total while we were there .   come on ,  cleveland ! 
__label__3 the flavouring on the food was very good however i noticed it to be a bit salty across the board ,  perhaps owing to the ajus .  the waitress was very nice and good and the lady she was training was very nice as well although she was not quite getting the hang of it  ( she did several things our main waitress then fixed such as put the knives in the wrong spot on the table )  .  the salad which is included with all meals is prepared table side which was very cool .  this however is one area where the concept could be improved on .  the waitress faces the table with the large salad bowl in front of her tray and the plates she serves it on behind the big bowl preventing you from seeing it very well .  for all the work she does with the tomatoes she could do this in front of the bowl so the guests can see .  as with the large cart the chef brings out to serve the main courses - this could be improved too .  the chef greeted us but then his back was to us and he did not look back or explain what he was doing ,  the cuts of meat or anything .  for all the trouble of brining out the huge cart the chef should at least face the guests and say some speech about the meat .  the whole idea of ordering ahead of time seems odd to me since the various items to order are just various thickness of prime rib which could be decided on table side .  i also did hear the waitress tell another table they had run out of filet .  i ordered one and there were three separate occasions where it was too fatty to chew .  .  .  .  mashed potatoes come with all the mains as well .  i ordered a broccoli side  ( $6 . 99 )  and requested no potatoes and when the bill came i was not charged for the side so that was nice .  .  . 
__label__1 seemed like a cool little bar to grab a glass of wine before a show .   this had to be the worst glass of cabernet we ' ve both ever had .   we were able to get down about half a glass before giving up and we never let wine go to waste !    we should have known when there was no wine list .   once we got the bill ,  we realized it was way overpriced .   we will not be back .    i know there ' s much more than wine here and maybe the food is good ,  but that definitely left a bad taste in our mouth ! 
__label__3 first ,  remember this is a tavern .  they also serve food .  while the beer offering is great  ( as it should be !  )  the food is ok .  i enjoyed my cheesesteak and pale ale .  she thought the bbq sauce was very good but the bread dried out .  remember why you ' re here and you ' ll do fine ! 
__label__4 every time i ' m in this area ,  i end up stopping here because let ' s face it - all the women in my family  ( myself included )  are crazy cat ladies .  even though this place is a little on the pricey side ,  they have the really high quality pet food you can ' t find at chains like innova evo ,  as well as the higher end brands that the chains have started carrying  ( innova ,  wellness ,  natural balance ,  etc )  .  every time i come here i end up buying what i ' m sure is an overpriced catnip-stuffed toy ,  but boy my cat loves the snot out of the thing ,  so who am i to say no .  i also bought a couple cute crinkle balls since one of my cats seems unaffected by catnip .  we ' ll see if they like them ,  but the other cat at least immediately started loving on the cute pink catnip-stuffed kitty i got her . 
__label__5 i shop here often ,  and it ' s a nice mid-scale grocery store .   the food is fresh ,  and they carry a few special items like candies and gums i ' ve never seen before .   prices are very good esp when they have sales .   they also serve hot foods .   get me thru the line quickly ,  and the cashiers are all very nice .   great 60s and 70s music plays as i shop .   parking can iffy depending on time of day ,  but i can usually get a pretty close spot in the back of the building  ( where it ' s free ) 
__label__1 pretty awful supermarket .  their items are out of stock most of the time .  the produce is not very pretty .  the workers their are very rude ,  as well .  furthermore ,  i do not like that all of the healthier food is either not sold here or the price is jacked up way higher than it would be at walmart or target .  i live about a block away from this supermarket but i choose to drive 10-20 minutes to go to heinens ,  whole foods ,  or target . 
__label__5 my daughter tipped me off to this place .   i ' d been passing it for years .   i went in with my 1963 mercury which had a stalling problem .   we popped the hood and one of the guys fixed the vacuum hose in 10 min .   no problem .   you get honest ,  hard work from these guys who are fair and have great prices .   highly recommended ! 
__label__4 wow ,  what a diverse ,  yet eclectic ,  vintage shop .  from clothes to antiques ,  this is a hotspot in cleveland to stop at . 
__label__4 love love love !  if you don ' t mind wading through rooms and rooms and rooms of vintage ,  this place is for you .  you think you ' re done ,  and then you just discover another nook and cranny .  literally ,  the place is broken up into random tiny rooms .  it ' s a lot !    the majority of the items are home goods and clothing .  there ' s a tiny record section ,  but nothing huge .  i was also a little bummed the jewelry selection was so small ,  but maybe it ' s not something they focus on .  clearly the focus is on clothes and home goods .    you can probably find something from every decade ,  but it seems like the majority of things are 50-70 ' s .  i could have probably spent hours looking at all the items piled high but concentrated mostly on clothes .  which like i said ,  was broken up into tiny rooms .  i ' d say maybe 15 of them !    there was no real rhyme or reason for the rooms in terms of organization .  a couple rooms loosely had a theme ,  like coats or cardigans / jackets ,  but most was a hodgepodge .  while it would have been nice to have it well organized .  .  .  it ' s not necessarily something i expect .  i expect to dig .  .  .  which i did !    i ended up with less than i though ,  probably because i had to dig and had a limited amount of time ,  but i came out with an adorable plaid 60 ' s shift dress and a cool 50 ' s cluster ring .  if i had more time ,  i would have spent it on the home goods next ,  but my focus was on the clothes !   prices were all across the board .  there were a few things i might have bought ,  but i thought it was a little overpriced .  unless it was my bad that i didn ' t recognize a brand name or that it was in pristine condition .  my ring and dress came to a little under $50 ,  which was totally reasonable to me .    can ' t wait to visit again to find some groovy decorations ! 
__label__5 i love flower child .   i have bought many things from them over the years .   great stuff . 
__label__5 neighborhood gay bar .  non-pretentious .  there are all types for all types .  it ' s real ,  down-to-earth from twink to rugged--all shapes and sizes .  staff is very friendly and ready to serve .  get off your "high horse" ,  and ride the hawk to a great time ! 
__label__4 this bar is a great down to earth place to stop and have a drink .   most people are blue collar regulars and are friendly and welcoming .   the crowd is mixed and features all colors ,  sexual orientations ,  and incomes .   everyone blends together very pleasantly .   this is a shot and a beer joint .   don ' t come here expecting to order a pink squirrel and sashay around a dance floor .   it ' s bare bones decor ,  but nicely decorated around holidays .   the neighborhood is a bit seedy but use some common sense and carry a sidearm and you ' ll be fine .   prices are very reasonable .   drinks are strong .   it ' s a gay bar but you wouldn ' t know it when you walk in .   it looks like any other bar in cleveland .   the difference is the people ,  they ' re down to earth and friendly .   if you ' re a snob and have the habit of looking down your nose at everyone else ,  you might want to try twist ,  as this is not a fashion or model event ,  although sometimes a young fashionista scarf model may prance into the hawk . 
__label__1 this is a hole in the wall-dive bar .    this area of cleveland is very dangerous !   keep this in mind if you are from out of town-go in groups .   parking is along the street  ( very limited )  is only for a couple of cars and then you must park on the side streets and i got asked for money from several people from the bus stop on detroit ave outside the bar .    once i got in the bar the restrooms are very dirty and the piss smell comes into the bar .   the drinks are very strong and very cheaply priced .   this place is for the town drunk that likes to sit and drink all day .    the crowd here is lower middle class so do not expect a quality conversations here if you are a business professional stopping in after work for happy hour .   i went one day in a suit and tie after work and was looked at like i was from outer space when i walked in .   this is a very seedy bar that caters to that type of crowd-welfare and under / employed clevelanders .   did i mention on the way out of the bar i had a gentlemen follow me out asking for money for the bus and then when i said no he asked me for a ride home since he did not have bus fair- when i said no a second time he said he would preform a sexual favor for me if i give  him the money .   i got in my car and out the heck out of here . 
__label__1 the reviews are correct the drinks are strong .   that ' s the only highlight . the bartender was too busy chatting with regulars to tend bar .  nonetheless i tipped $2 for 1 drink .  the bartender couldn ' t be bothered to say thank you or anything else for that master .  i guess ,  they ' re only friendly to regulars .  never again ! 
__label__1 let me start off by saying that i only started a yelp account because of how absolutely rediculous my experience at this place was .   i brought my car in because my headlight was out -- not a big deal .   i dropped the car off and was told to come back around 5pm to pick it up .   so i get there at 5pm and wait 3 hours before the manager comes up to me and explains that they had lost a $300 part that is essentil for the headlight to work properly .   i was told to comeback the following monday and they would fix it for free  ( mind you that my headlight is still not working )  .   i brought my car back on monday but when i came back to pick it up the manager said that they still couldnt find the part they needed to fix it properly but that he rigged it with another part so that the light would work properly .   he basically told me that he had ghetto rigged it ,  but that it should still work .   wrong !   a couple nights later i looked at my headlights and noticed that the light they had "fixed" was less than half as bright as the other headlight .   i brought my car to another mechanic  ( a trustworthy mechanic that i should have brought my car to in the first place -- thats my own fault )  just to get a second opinion .   he told me that whoever tried to fix the headlight had absolutely no idea what they were doing and caused $1000 in damage to my car .   basically ,  instead of ordering the $300 piece that they had lost doing what should have been a $75 headlight fix ,  the gm decided to do $1000 in damages by not fixing their own mistake .     i wouldnt recommend this place to my worst enemy .   absolutely awful . 
__label__1 long story short: they tried to take advantage of my girlfriend because she didn ' t know much about cars .  when confronted ,  they refused to do any work at the quoted price citing safety concerns but offered to do the work if i bought the more expensive  ( 4x )   ' lifetime warranty '  on the brakes .  details below .    my girlfriend went in for a brake job which was quoted at $115 ,  they call her a few hours later telling her she needs to replace the rotors and the calipers and it ' ll cost $785 .  she calls me and i head over to firestone to see how a $115 job turned into a $785 job .  they tell me that the calipers are frozen ,  i ask them how they diagnosed this ,  they tell me they did a visual inspection but offered no real diagnostic test .   to show me ,  they place a tool on the steering wheel that depresses brakes and spins the rotors .  unconvinced ,  i decide to depress the brake myself ,  lo and behold ,  the rotors did not move and the calipers are engaged .  so i ask them to do the brakes for the quoted price and leave the calipers alone .  they offer to replace the brakes and rotors for $465 and give me a lifetime warranty .  i decline and ask them to do the brakes for the quoted price and they tell me they are unable to do so citing safety concerns ,  even though they just offered to do them if i paid for the more expensive package .   they clearly just advertised a price to entice customers and then choose to screw them over to make extra cash .  i took it down to another shop without telling them what happened at firestone .  they replaced the rotors and brakes for $235 with no hassle .  when we pick up the car i ask them if there was anything wrong with the calipers ,  they told me they were in great condition .     this was the worst experience i ' ve ever had with a company . 
__label__5 img was one of the places we checked out when shopping for my husband and i ' s wedding bands .   this was 1 of 2 jewelry stores we really loved .   the salesman we worked with was incredibly helpful and very nice .   i was able to quickly find a wedding band that matched perfectly with my engagement ring .   the price was great too for the top quality diamonds we had put into the settings .   they also had some very classy and stylish mens wedding bands that were specially crafted and were very unique .   my husband was more picky than me when trying out rings and was very difficult to please .   we loved a few pieces here but he ended up choosing a band somewhere else because he likes the tungsten metal rings and liked a specific design on a particular band at another store .   my ring was custom ordered ,  and when it came in it was too snug but they were able to resize it and get it back to me within the week .   overall great selection and customer service . 
__label__1 i was given a different address than the one listed:  19451 euclid avenue euclid ,  oh 44117  however ,  the phone number is still the same ,  so i am assuming it is the same business .   we discovered our home had bed bugs and called charles ,  who came to our home that day and arrived promptly .  he explained to us that ,  depending on the degree of infestation ,  it may take several treatments to actually alleviate the situation .  however ,  once he received his $850 ,  the prompt response and courteous service were the only things that disappeared .     we were told that ,  depending on the size of infestation ,  it may take several treatments in order for the bed bugs to go away .   we continued to see bed bugs ,  so we made a call for a follow-up appointment and was given a 2-hour window .  charles '  associate not only did not make his 2-hour window but he missed it by over 5 hours .  once he arrived ,  he was in a rush to leave for the day and only sprayed the "critical items" rather than the entire house .   subsequent visits resulted in more delays and even less courteous service .  they were suddenly so busy that they could not get us an appointment for days ,  sometimes a week at a time .  i missed hours of work while waiting on them to arrive during their two-hour window ,  only to continually miss it by hours at a time .  we were told previously there was 24 / 7 service but called several times on a sunday only for someone to answer and tell us "call back tomorrow . "  phone calls were no longer being returned .  finally ,  when we did get charles on the phone ,  we were told that  ( despite still seeing bed bugs )  they were no longer going to show up without additional payment  ( despite not "exterminating" anything )  ,  and even went as far as blaming us for "re-introducing" the bed bugs into the home .     for the record ,  we had basically never been in the bedroom ,  sleeping on the couch for almost two months ,  while this was going on .   how we could "re-introduce" something in a room while never being in that room is beyond me .   if you have $850 to throw around and you would like random people uselessly walking around your home with cans of pesticide that are not effective ,  call this company .   if you would like to spend every weekend during your summer looking through the living room window waiting for these random people to show because they gave you a scheduled time and then never make it on time ,  call this company .    ( seriously ,  if you are given a 9am window ,  how can you end up being 5 hours late ?   how many people could you schedule before 9am on a saturday that you are 5 hours late ?  )   most importantly ,  if you have an insect problem in your home ,  and want to call an "exterminator" simply to make the bugs feel bad ,  call charles and "precise pest discomfort services" .   they will be happy to show up and take your money and definitely not exterminate anything .   better yet ,  just call me and i will gladly take your money and won ' t even hassle you about showing up and you won ' t have to waste your weekends waiting for them to show up .  at this time ,  the only pests that have been removed from my home since i hired this company has been this company ' s associates themselves . 
__label__4 well ,  well market square park--it looks like you had some work done .  oh ,  don ' t be shy ,  there ' s nothing wrong with a nip here and a tuck there .    it was honestly a little difficult for me to see the old park get knocked down when all of my first wsm memories involves hanging out over there .  in fact ,  i remember taking a school field trip all the way from painesville city just to shoot our high school newscast from the market .  afterwards we all came out and took pictures in the park underneath those weird awnings .  but since then ,  its been a long ,  long time since i felt like i could enjoy myself at market square park without the smell of urine ,  seeing human feces in the corners and just feeling safe as a young woman .    now ,  i couldn ' t be happier !  to see the park redone ,  packed to the gills for the wsm centennial celebration--it definitely has new lease on life !  first ,  the built in stage is awesome !  i ' m hoping to catch some great ,  live shows here this summer .  it ' s not huge ,  but hell ,  it ' s perfect for the area and i think it ' s way better than before .  i also love that there ' s nowhere for folks to hide to use the potty in public .  that may sound mean ,  but this is our city ,  people .  we all want to be able to use the public areas to the fullest potential .  the tables are great for grabbing some messy noms from the market and grabbing a seat ,  although i wish there were even more areas to do so .    i think with the new ohio city ambassadors and the park renovations ,  this is going to once again be a place that all clevelanders can enjoy !  don ' t miss out on the new series of open air markets hosted every saturday afternoon this summer ,  as well .  we ' ll just keep market square park at 4 stars for now until we see how everything unfolds . 
__label__5 as a librarian  ( of the non-public-variety )  ,  i am a huge library advocate ,  and i can say without hesitation that ch-uh is the cream of the crop .  the main library ,  which is the branch i frequent ,  is a major hub of activity for the neighborhood ,  boasting a large av collection  ( let ' s go down to the library and rent us up some movies )  ,  a teen room  ( soundproofed )  and excellent collections of books .  yes ,  books !  ch-uh is part of the clevnet consortium ,  too ,  so if they don ' t have something you want on-site ,  it ' s pretty easy to get it from another library in the system ,  and fairly quickly to boot .   the library system recently started to lend kindles and other ereaders ,  an innovative program i ' m pretty curious about myself .  i think there are also toy-lending programs for kids and other special lending programs .  heights libraries have really done a good job of changing with the times and adapting to the community ' s needs .    there are two lots for the library: one behind the main library building on the east side of lee and another behind the old y annex  ( where dobama theater is housed )  on the west side .  on any given weekend day the main lot is usually jam-packed ,  which is a testament to how much heights residents love their library . 
__label__5 it ' s a nice library .   it ' s well laid out for browsing ,  and ,  being part a huge system ,  it ' s easy to go online and reserve almost anything when i want something specific .   there ' s plenty of places to sit and read ,  and tons of public computers .   the kid area is huge with books and toys for little ones ,  and their story times are nice too .   in short: everything a local library should do ,  this one does . 
__label__5 wow .  .  .  so ,  the other day  ( and this would have to happen after a difficult day ,  making it more difficult ,  )  i was on my way home when my car started sounding like a rocket ship .   my old toyota  ( edging up on 200 , 000 miles ,  yep ,  i drive em hard ,  )  had a blow out in the connecting pipe between the muffler and converter .  previously ,  i ' d had folks tell me i needed a whole new muffler system ,  and i ' m not rich ,  so the 1200 to 1500 they were quoting me was just too much .   i was sort of desperate ,  and asked around .  after talking to my brother-in-law and doing some research online ,  i found all star discount muffler .  .  .   and was amazed .  .  .   all star is located just off of w . 130th in an unassuming neighborhood .  now ,  when i headed out there i was told; get there early .  they only do things by first come ,  first serve .  no reservations .  why ?   they ' re that freaking busy !  !   ( and that freaking good .  )  they opened the gates at 8:30 am ,  and as i and two more vehicles drove in .  .  . so did a dozen more .  people from all over bring their cars in just by word of mouth ,  and the mix of people ,  from housewives to businessmen to even other mechanics shows how trusted these folks are .     the place is no-frills; there ' s some benches in the main office area ,  and you can wait or come back ,  but i ' ll tell you ,  you don ' t have to wait long .    the staff like dave and amy are thoughtful ,  efficient and what i like about it is that dave took me under my vehicle and showed me what they were going to do and then quoted me a price .    i didn ' t need a whole system; i needed a pipe between the converter and the muffler ,  which was still quite good and didn ' t need replacing .  that was it .    with parts and labor folks; 40$ and in and out in about 40 minutes .    again ,  this is no frills ,  but they will not gyp you !   i saw testimonials here ,  on other review sites ,  and there were a dozen or more on a peg board in the office written on business cards ,  stationary and formal letterhead .  people are thankful for great service and a good deal .     ( heck ,  while i was there ,  two guys from other auto places brought cars in to be repaired because they couldn ' t .  : )  also ,  all of their work carries guarantees as long as you keep your receipts ,  and i ' ve heard they honor the work they do .     so ,  if you want to be treated well ,  and get all star prices ,  try all star discount muffler for your brake ,  shock ,  and exhaust needs; you ' re wallet and your car will thank you: ) 
__label__4 no regrets !  this was a "let ' s do this again" family fun time .  our table of 7 ,  seated comfortably with great views .   the nautica queen is good looking .   their service ,  from  ,  crew ,  dj ,  & music ,  helped to make us happy & content .   they offered a wide variety of brunch fare ,  blintz ,  waffles ,  eggs ,  sausage ,  ham ,  chicken & salad were just some of the tasty buffet style offerings .  drinks & beverages were very good as well . 
__label__4 we went on the father ' s day brunch cruise .     your picture is taken as you enter the boat ,  the pics are sold after the cruise as a 20 buck package .    upon entering the boat you are escorted to your assigned table .  our server was very pleasant ,  explained the dining process and took our drink orders .  certain beverages were included such as coffee and tea ,  alcohol and pop were for purchase .  i had a peach bellini that was very tasty and my son had a smoothie that he enjoyed .     once the boated departed the buffet was opened ,  each table was dismissed in order .  the server followed to the buffet to carry the salad plate back to the table .  .  . nice touch .  the food was good and well flavored .    sitting out on the boat upper deck was beautiful ,  perfect sun and breeze . 
__label__1 there ' s a racquet going on with groupon under no circumstances is there a way to change the date or get a refund for unused event i contacted both as was given the run around so my money was just stolen for no services rendered . 
__label__3 it meets the indian grocery needs ,  but the owner has an attitude . 
__label__3 first ,  let me say that my wife and i have liked this place since we started coming .  for us it ' s a 40 minute drive and there are much closer clubs we could go to .  the girls here all seem friendly and not as stuck-up as other clubs .  music was a pretty good mix of a little bit of everything .  lately ,  the music has been all hip hop and dub step ,  when it used to be a variety based on the girls '  tastes .  you can tell a difference in the performance when they are actually into what they are dancing to vs when they have to force it .  now ,  i like the idea of having feature dancers ,  and the last one was a lot of fun ,  but don ' t advertise that she ' s going on at 10 ,  then make everyone wait until 11:20 .  by 10:30 ,  a lot of the people that came to see her got impatient and left .  another note ,  you might want to fix your parking lot .   the giant pot holes don ' t give a very good impression even though the actual club is pretty nice . 
__label__5 i went here with some friends for one of their eighteenth birthdays .  even though i ' m a straight female ,  i still had a great time !  it was very classy ,  the dancers knew what they were doing  ( i had no idea it took so much strength to use those poles !  )  and everyone was quite nice there .  being under 21 ,  you are required to pay twenty five dollars to get in ,  but you get two free table dances via crazy horse bucks .  regular admission is ten . 
__label__3 let us move on to the next stop on cara ' s tour de cle strip clubs ,  shall we ?    i ' m pretty torn here between two visits .  my first time was pretty great .  it was later in the evening ,  there were girls  ' a plenty and while there were some that looked like they came in straight from a nap ,  there were at least a few that were really attractive .  plus ,  couples get in free on saturdays .  can ' t beat that !  there were two stages being utilized by girls who had more upper body strength than i ' ll ever have .  and i loved the groups of men and women participating and celebrating various occasions  ( i . e .  birthday parties ,  bachelor / ette parties .  )  it didn ' t just seem like a men ' s only kind of place .  the girls are very nice and will also sit to chat with you ,  if you so desire .  and lastly ,  the bartender is a delight !  she ' s cute and interesting--one of my favorite parts about this place .    now let ' s fast forward to my most recent trip .  .  .  what ' s with dancers eating at the bar ?  does anyone else find this as gross as i do ?  i ' m sorry--i know we ' re all human .  i know these ladies need to eat ,  but please ,  not in front of me and not on your shift in front of customers .  i saw four girls hunched over plates inhaling food with manners of a teenage boy .  i ' m talking about snagging food from the plates of others ,  sour cream on faces ,  shoveling food .  i don ' t know who would want a stomach full of spicy bar food before flipping upside down on a pole .  but just thinking about that made my stomach turn and tainted the evening .  mind you ,  it ' s a personal rule of mine never to eat at strip clubs--no matter how good everyone claims the food is--so ,  this could be why i feel so strongly .  but if it were up to me ,  the girls would eat in a room in the back ,  just like any other job out there .    you can certainly have a 4-star experience here ,  but as you can see ,  it depends on the night . 
__label__3 they have really good food and nice service .  i ordered the chicken philly and it was huge and it came with a lot of fries .  my children love their whole wings and they are picky eaters .  i also had a polish boy but didn ' t get to eat it .  i was also quite large .  they definitely give you your money ' s worth . 
__label__5 this is for nicole at aaa in ladera ranch .  .  .  . not only did she book our family cruise .  .  .  .  .  .  . she stayed after hours to book all of our dinner reservations ,  excursions ,  and shows / on board requests !  !  !  !  so patient ,  kind ,  efficient and helpful !  !    turned our frustrating journey into something we look forward too .    above & beyond the call of duty !  !  !   please ask for nicole next time you want to travel thru aaa !  !   you will be so excited about your trip !  ! 
__label__5 just about any flavor aka type of beer you could want .  food is filling ,  fast and good .  the staff here at beckys are friendly and fun . 
__label__4 i ' ve been into becky ' s several times since moving to the neighborhood and have had all very positive experiences for the most part .  i was pleasantly surprised as to how good the food is - i ' ve had the burger ,  wings ,  salad .  .  . all very good for bar food .  probably some of the best i ' ve had in all of cleveland for cheap bar food actually .  the best part about this bar is the wide variety of people you will see here - from the college 21 year old white boy to the 65 year old city worker black woman - you will see all ranges of colors and ages which is cool to see . 
__label__3 becky ' s ,  i haven ' t seen you since undergrad .    ( oy !   i have realized this is now many moons ago .  .  .  )   becky ' s pretty much is the same as it was in my undergrad years  ( i will refrain from saying how many years ago that was .  .  .  )  with minor differences .   i . e the old pool table is now no longer in the front of the place ,  in fact ,  there is no pool table .     i think the menu is the same as it was ahem years ago and the burgers are still yummy as well as the fries .     darts are in the back ,  as before ,  and so are the bathrooms .   careful to avoid the darts on your way to the john .     bartenders were cool .     an a-ok in my book .   and a heck of alot faster than the hoffbrauhaus aross the street . 
__label__4 once again yelp did us right !   found this place and had a great time .  went here to have a few drinks before a show and the people were very nice .  had a good happy hour and the service was good .  .  .  . actually left and forgot or tickets to the show on the bar and when we called back they were holding them for us .  really saved our a$$ !   thanks again !  !  ! 
__label__4 walked in to discuss a tattoo i wanted and met with nate .  he was very receptive to my ideas and came in early a few days later for the actual inking to accommodate my busy schedule .  thanks nate !  shop was clean and neat as well . 
__label__5 normally when a place is out of the food i want ,  i wouldn ' t give it 5 stars however ,  the cashier went out of his way to ensure that my family and i were taken care of .  he offered suggestions in place of what i originally wanted and had a delicious calzone made .  .  .  it took a little longer to make since it was not pre made to heat up ,  so we sat down and he unexpectedly brought it over to us .  5 stars for him .  we will come back . 
__label__3 delivery was quick the food was average they need to change their oil !  !  a lil pricey i order sweet and sour chicken it was $11 and had to add more food because the delivery is min$15 .  chicken was over cooked .  might order again if i am in the area defiantly not my first or second choice
__label__5 our family moved to cleveland 4 years ago .  we have finally found "our" chinese food place !  the owners are nice and the delivery crew is respectful and prompt .  my husband said he hasn ' t had chinese food like that since moving from mass .  17 years ago .  i like the online ordering .  i had an issue with ordering because i live 4 miles away  ( lyndhurst )  and almost immediately after emailing them they fixed the problem .  the food is always hot when it arrives and taste delicious . 
__label__5 so ,  when we move to a new city one of the things that always hard is finding a great hairstylist .   well i got pretty lucky with tony at mandalfinos !  he was great !  he gave me exactly that cut i wanted and is very experienced not to mention hilarious !  the hour flew by !  they were extremely accommodating and super nice .  if you live downtown its just the perfect place !  !  i would highly recommend him !  the haircut is $50
__label__5 gary is amazing !  he does a great job at keeping my highlights looking amazing and natural ! 
__label__5 this place is now cuisine du cambodge - a southeast asian restaurant which specializes in cambodian cuisine .   this is a must visit place ,  with the same awesome food as before !  stuffed wings are amazing !  pad thai is the best around !  very authentic cooking ! 
__label__3 the food deserves 5 stars but the dining room had a funky odor- not nice .  i think the roof leaked and the carpet mildewed .  anyway this restaurant is gone .  its now cuisine du cambodge and phnom penh has moved to north olmsted .  haven ' t tried either new place . 
__label__1 i don ' t know !  happys pizza ,  what do i say its not bad but its not the best .  first thing i have to say is the menu is so big for a place that has pizza in it ' s name ,  i can understand the wings and even the sandwiches .  but shrimp ,  fish ,  burgers ,  fried chicken ,  hot dogs  ( or as they call them happy dogs )  etc .   and with such a big menu i know that about 100% of it is all frozen food .  yes even the pizza tastes like it was frozen .  but i did get some things you might not find on a pizza shops menu ,  like fried shrooms and chili cheese fries .  first of all the shrooms had heavy breading and watered down ranch dressing .  the fries are good ,  but something you can do at home with some frozen fries a can of chili and some frito lay nacho cheese sauce .    i also ordered a steak sub  ( that came with fries and about 1 / 2oz of cole slaw ,  that i did not touch )  ,  and some wings with two diffrent flavor sauces .  i opened the box that the sub came in ,  and the thick white styrafoam container the wings came in and just like everything else frozen food .  the sub bread was nice and soft and was still soft even after a good heating in the micro .  but it was nothing but pressed together beef ,  with un-cooked red onions and un-melted cheese ,  and super sweet steak sauce .   the wings ,  well .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  again something they cooked out of a bag from out of the freezer .  heavy breading i couldn ' t find any of the chicken on the bone ,  and when i could it wasn ' t much .  the sauce was ok but because of the heavy breading on them you couldn ' t taste the sauce .  the sauce in the bottom of the container was good if only it could have made the breading taste that way .    so maybe i will order happys pizza again if my freezer is empty ,  and if i need super fast delivery of food .  but other than that i will keep my money in my purse .  and cook even on the nights i don ' t want to . 
__label__2 time-day 7pm wednesday .  for mid-week ,  we waited 1 hour and 15 minutes for delivery - from det .  sw to ohc .  1 med pizza w / two toppings and 1 large "hawaiian" plus a 2 ltr .  was $30 .  yeah i thought that was kind of ridiculous ,  but it was 90 degrees outside ,  i have no car ,  and our microwave is broken .  so it was either pizza delivery or walk to the convenience store at the corner of fulton and lorain to get overpriced junk with a side of crazy ,  drunk panhandlers .  well ,  having had a sandwich from that happy ' s location that was mediocre at best ,  i wasn ' t expecting miracles .  the pizza was passable at least .  toppings were all in place ,  and unlike the pizza we got from nunzio ' s and sent back ,  it wasn ' t so greasy that it could qualify as a colonic .  overall ,  if i had little other choice ,  i ' d order from happy ' s again .  it just seems kind of pricey for something that wasn ' t really much better than little ceasar ' s $5 round .  the search for good delivery pizza in ohc continues .  damn marco ' s on memphis won ' t deliver over the bridge ,  so for now my money ' s on guy ' s pizza on superior .   ( by the way fellow yelpers ,  just know how happy i am to be back in cle writing about all these places i thought i might never call home again !  ) 
__label__4 a midwest chain that is much better than most of the national pizza chains .  great combo deals .  the pizzas are just above average but the extensive menu and late hours make up for it .  the garlic bbq xl whole wings are my secret guilty pleasure . 
__label__1 there ' s an interesting adage among men that goes ,  "sex is like pizza ,  there ' s no such thing as bad pizza . " well i ' m not going to ruminate on the former right now ,  but the latter myth about the pizza has been completely debunked by happys pizza .    i ' ll start with the highlights .  i was drawn into the store by an empty stomach with a pizza craving ,  the "neon light sign on acid" happys pizza pizza parlor decor ,  and the promise of a large specialty pizza for a mere $10 bucks approximately .  it gets better .  three "barely-legal" young ladies happily welcomed me into the well-lit ,  hiphop-music filled point-of-sale .  these things are what earned my one star rating but sadly ,  from there it was downhill .  .  .    barely after i entered my order ,  paid ,  and retreated to the window sill seating ,  i noticed just how "happy" the staff really was to be there .  the counter staff immediately began texting ,  loudly gossiping all their business ,  and actually serving themselves soda in paper cups directly from the 2-liter customer cooler behind the register .  i half expected them to put the half-drained 2-liter bottle back in the cooler when they were done ,  to keep it cool .    my comfortable perch on the window sill allowed me to also observe the staff preparing the food .  things weren ' t quite so festive back there .  first of all ,  the ethnic divide was stark and more than obvious .  trust me ,  walking from the counter to the back seemed tantamount to walking into a different neighborhood or maybe even a different country .  .  . and they were consistently working .  i was p ! $$@d for them ,  so i could imagine how they felt .  i was just hoping at this point that they weren ' t taking it out on my pizza .    surprisingly the pizza was finished on time ,  although i wouldn ' t have known it if i was relying on the counter staff .  i had to interrupt one of the girls who was on her cell phone when i realized the box that had been placed on the rack behind the counter had my name on it .  without interrupting her convo she handed me my dinner .  .  . she did give a big smile and mouth the words "thank you" tho .   now for the food .  i ' ll make it quick .  i ' ll just say that the pizza was like nothing i have tasted before .  .  . not in a good way .  the pizza sauce was a weird kind of sweet ,  much sweeter than any i have ever tasted .  .  . makes me suspect ketchup ,  and the crust was very bland .  .  . and i am a crust guy .  i got a vegy specialty pizza and we ' ll just say the veggies were nowhere near the level of let ' s say a dewey ' s ,  let alone a papa john ' s or other chain .  they seemed canned .   what should i expect from a $10 specialty pizza right ?  i couldn ' t eat more than one piece .  i didn ' t bother to take it back .    for a second ,  i was a bit worried about my unique name attached to this review and having to take on an alias if i ever went back to happys ,  then i had to check myself .  .  . i ' m never going to be going back to happys . 
__label__4 i ' ve always had a good experience here .   for fast-food pizza ,  this place is tops for me .   i always do carry out ,  so i can ' t speak to delivery ,  but my orders are done fast and correct ,  and the service has been fine .   it ' s not fancy ,  artisan pizza ,  it ' s fast-food pizza .   as far as fast-food pizza ,  the price to quality ratio is great .   i can get a large pizza with a few toppings for super cheap .   i usually order my pizzas with extra cheese and a double bake  ( well done )  and it comes out perfect every time .   i ' m super happy with this joint . 
__label__5 this is an awesome out of the way little place for breakfast / lunch .  it is an art gallery / coffee / breakfast / lunch place .  i know its a lot .  it is on a quiet little street and has some nice cafe style table out front .  someone else mentioned i am not sure where you would sit inside as there are no tables ,  but i am sure they will figure that out as the summer rolls away .    i love getting the delicious peanut butter banana and honey sandwich and having some nice quiet time at lunch outside .    i love secret little places and thats exactly what this feels like . 
__label__5 wow !   the brother ' s burrito with chicken though !  ?  out of this world good .   i hate to compare chiptole but it ' s like ,  you kinda have to .  so ,  sorry chipotle .    chipotle has never been a favorite of mine .  when everyone was delcaring chipotle the best mexican food they ' ve ever had ,  i wanted to sling shot myself into outerspace because who wants to live on a planet where people believe that ?   i came to ocb not really expecting something to blow me away but oooh it did .  i ' m a big cheese fan and i always order extra cheese on everything  ( yeah ,  i know it ' s unhealthy .  big whoop ,  wanna fight about it ?  )  .  the cheese in my brother ' s chicken burrito was so very delicious - i don ' t know what the difference is  ( maybe having two cheeses is a factor )  but boy is it gooood !  the chips were phenom too as well as my gauc .  nice and lumpy with no crunchy nasty onions in the mix !    i ate half my burrito and took the rest to go .  then got home a few hours later and ate the rest !  no leftovers for tomorrow ,  sadly .   the place is so very quaint ,  well decorated with a mexican theme  ( duh )  and the employees were nice  ( and they were quick which is muy importante !  !  )   the only thing i was disappointed in was the horchata .  it tasted more like hornada .  bleh !  it was like drinking cinnamon water ,  no ma ' am !  funny thing is ,  i actually bookmarked and eventually came to ocb for the sole purpose of trying out their horchata .  buying a burrito was an afterthought ,  ha ! 
__label__4 i usually get a chicken burrito bowl .   ingredients are always fresh and flavorful and great portion .  price is very good compared to other burrito places like chiptole .   ocb doesn ' t charge extra for guac .   staff is always friendly . 
__label__4 i have made the trek  ( 20 minutes )  to ocb twice in the past week .  both visits yielded exceptional ,  tasty ,  and fresh burritos .  i will eighty-six chipotle from my "fast" food preferences in favor of ohio city burrito .  in fact ,  chipotle does not sound appetizing to me anymore .    the atmosphere in this local joint is welcoming and the staff is very friendly .  i got a burrito with carnitas ,  guac ,  sour cream ,  rice ,  beans ,  an array of salsas ,  lettuce ,  and cheese .  unlike chipotle ,  you can taste each ingredient in every bite .  continuing that thread ,  the guac and sour cream are distributed evenly throughout the burrito  ( both of which are free )  .  the ingredients are superior to chipotle ' s .  the flavors omitted from them are bold vs .  bland and predictable .     *i do not mean to compare the two .  the reality is- until ocb ,  chipotle was the best burrito i had ever tasted . *  i highly recommend ocb to anyone in the cleveland area ! 
__label__4 supporting local small business .   lol be to see hard working people living their dreams .  great food great service ,  great location .   great alternative to chipotle
__label__2 i so wanted an independent burrito place in my neighborhood to be awesome .  but it was a big letdown .  undercooked rice is always a burrito killer . 
__label__3 i was visiting from nyc where we have great canollis ,  so i was excited to try this one after reading reviews .  i was very disappointed .  the shell was fine but the cream was very lackluster .  it tasted as if it was missing sugar .  i didn ' t even bother finishing it ,  as it wasn ' t worth the calories .   however ,  i will say the tiramisu was delightful .  light and sweet and one of the best i ' ve had . 
__label__1 rude staff !  nothing kills it like having a bunch of rude staff .  no matter how the food is !  and the food is ok .  as it would be in an italian place .  my third visit here they had this constant cacophony which lasted for atleast 30 minutes before i asked an overweight middle aged female staff what it was and how long it would continue .  she was rude unapologetic about the noise and was like  ' seriously ?  that ' s the bread being cut .  the business has to go on .  '  snickering behind my back .  it lasted for 20 more minutes before i decided to leave .  that ' s not how you treat customers .  if you know it ' s going to make that amount of noise you take the machine inside away from the seating area .  pity i liked the ambience of the place .  it has lovely lighting good seating .  but i won ' t ever return and world never recommend anyone to come here . 
__label__4 the place was crazy crowded with people not understanding the whole deal about taking a number and then calling numbers .  they had taken numbers but then they felt that there was some reason that they still needed to put their nose against the glass .  whatever .  i got my number and took a seat .   presti ' s isn ' t just a bakery but that ' s why i was here .  they still have a big deli counter of sandwiches and salads and other ready-to-eat delicious looking things .  lasagna ?  pasta salad ?  tomato mozzarella salad ?  fruit salad ?  all looked delicious .   but i was here for the baked treats .  so many to choose from .  brownies  ( coconut ,  peanut butter and regular chocolate )  ,  cream puffs ,  eclairs ,  almond horns ,  all sort of tastiness !  i went with a simple canoli and a handful of linzers  ( apricot and raspberry )  .  heavenly ! 
__label__4 on this most recent trip i ordered a chocolate dipped coconut macaroon ,  a handful of pignoli cookies  ( my absolute favorite cookie )  ,  a cinnamon bun and a handful of thumbprint raspberry cookies .    this place seems yo have it all !  they have savory items that you can eat for lunch and dinner and they have all the delicious pastries / cookies you can think of as well as a well sized selection of gelatos and even an espresso machine to make your favorite coffee drinks . 
__label__4 i had presti ' s cater an event for my residency program .  for the dinner ,  we ordered 2 vegetarian stromboli ,  1 sausage strombolo ,  1 / 2 pan of meat lasagna ,  1 / 2 pan of vegetarian lasagna ,  and 1 pan of salad .    overall ,  our experience with the staff was phenomenal .  our order was done on time ,  and the staff helped me carry the order out to the car .  they also had receipts ready as i left .  ordering over the phone was easy ,  and every person i interacted with on the way was wonderful .   as far as the food goes ,  overall ,  we were wowed .    lasagna: excellent .  both the vegetarian and meat lasagna were a hit ,  and definitely fed more people than we thought they would .  there was a great amount of cheese ,  and everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned .   stromboli: the meat stromboli was a hit ,  but the vegetarian strombolo was not the greatest .  don ' t get me wrong: it was good ,  but i probably would order something else off the menu; the inside was a bit bland ,  though it was well cooked .   salad: pretty standard salad overall: lettuce ,  tomato ,  olives ,  cucumber .  fantastic balsamic dressing that everyone loved .   i will absolutely have presti ' s cater another event ,  and i am excited to eat more of their delicious food ! 
__label__1 pathetic and over priced for what we were given .  .  .  .  not impressed with this establishment .  .  . i believe over the years the quality has deteriorated from sharps .  .  .  . next time ur better off eating bread and that ' s it
__label__2 i ' ve been going here since the 80 ' s  /  every time i go back though ,  it just doesn ' t seem good anymore .  50% of the time i end up with old bread and i really wonder how long they keep their meat .  .  .  since it can be pretty slimey at times .  it pains me to say it ,  but i probably have had my last sharpy ' s sub .  : ( 
__label__4 not a bad greasy sub place .  waffle fries are out of this world ! 
__label__5 does not get any better .  real hometown feel .  great patio ,  great food ,  great drinks ,  great staff .  jb would be proud . 
__label__3 we ' ve been taking our daughter to the y for over a year now .   we started her out with swimming lessons ,  which she still takes .   now ,  we ' re doing basketball ,  which she loves .   it ' s great to have this ymca in parma because the city has never built a recreation center .   i guess it ' s good from the city ' s budget perspective ,  but it ' s one of the bane ' s of living in parma .   the y is not a top notch-facility because it is small and cramped ,  but at least it ' s here .   i ' m not complaining ,  but i ' d love to see this place expand .   it ' s where i took my first swimming lesson as a kid and i ' m glad to see that it hasn ' t outlived its usefulness .   two thumbs up to the staff for showing up and making a difference in peoples '  lives every day .   if they have internet ,  i am going to donate a wireless router so that parents have something to do while their kids are in sports classes . 
__label__3 get ready parma ,  you will now be traveling to the north royalton - family y to enjoy your membership .   this will make the already crowded facilities there even more crowded .   also ,  be sure to stop by at the other ugly glass boxy building ,  the new north royalton branch county library .   the mayor thought this would be so great ,  because he could place his new city hall in the old library building which was to have been remodeled and expanded .   lo and behold we will now have two communities sharing facilities----but the lease the y has is with north royalton ,  and it is north royalton residents that subsidize and maintain the building with service workers and our tax dollars .   what a joke this has all become .   but hey ,  maybe they ' ll expand the parking and add some more stop lights . 
__label__1 i ' ve gone to this y for many years and have not enjoyed seeing it age ungracefully .   the high point for the location was many  ( many )  years ago when they were advertising anticipated expansion plans .   it turned out ,  though ,  that was all a ruse to help get the parma rec center initiative defeated  ( "bate and switch" being the management ' s mantra apparently )  .   since then the location has continued to collapse in on itself while being poorly maintained ,  cutting operating hours ,  and sporting a staff that ' s unable to lift a finger to do so much as to clean the tv tubes .   all that can be had for the low ,  low price of two to three times what the competition charges .   with all those faults ,  how does it stay open ?   well get ready for the one star that this y deserves: the pool .   when it ' s not occupied by a swim team ,  the pool is very nice and makes for an affordable membership .   as well ,  if you have a family then its cheap ,  and if they like to swim then this place is really cheap . 
__label__5  ( ridgwewood ymca in parma )      my children started here with toddler swimming and now swim high school .  they have a great program for swimmers ,  and a fun team too .  their senior activities and social events are the best and most active in the county .  the location is getting up there in age but you couldn ' t find a greater group of members and staff ,  i am proud to call them friends .  a true family and welcoming atmosphere always . 
__label__3 - you ' re better off playing the lottery at that place than eating the wings which aren ' t that good at all .  however despite the bland decor and unsatisfactory wings ,   best steak and gyro does some things well .  the breakfast specials featuring sausage ,  bacon ,  home fries ,  and eggs however you want them is a huge plus .  also the steak specials aren ' t too shabby either .  to be honest you may want to get your food to go vs eating in the restuarant ,  but either option is ok . 
__label__4 one of my favorite lunch spots in cleveland .   the food is very reasonably priced and always great .   the matzoh ball soup is always great and they always have daily specials that change .   i am a huge fan of the buffalo chicken salad .  .  .  .  . you can always ask for it grilled as well and comes w cucumbers ,  tomatoes and sliced almonds .   the servers have been there for years and always friendly to us .     they also serve "yesterdays soup" for a little less cost than todays soup of the day .   i will continue to frequent alvies and enjoy the food and hospitality .   also .  .  .  .  . they close at 2pm .   i think the yelp hours are wrong
__label__5 alvie ' s is the reigning undisputed champ of the downtown diner circuit .  for a home cooked  ( style )  meal you can ' t beat alvie ' s .  i ' ve never had anything i wasn ' t completely satisfied with .  the menu is diverse and constantly has new daily specials ,  so there ' s always something to hit the spot of whatever you ' re feeling .   the staff is great ,  they ' re all personable and fun .  always prompt service ,  drinks rarely reach the bottom ,  and all the times i ' ve been there  ( probably going on 50 over the past year )  they ' ve never gotten an order wrong .   my one qualm is that the best sandwich i ' ve ever had ,  the country fried chicken sandwich ,  has only been on the menu once in close to 6 months .  it needs to be a staple of the menu !   i would advise you to go to alvie ' s as soon as possible ,  and give my personal guarantee you not be disappointed . 
__label__5 for what it is ,  a greasy spoon ,  downtown diner - it ' s perfect .  quiet ,  right across from the casino ,  with great real cleveland people taking care of you .  try the corned beef hash ,  exactly the way it should be . 
__label__5 love this place !  !  they did an absolutely fantastic job on our aussie /  retriever mix .  from the beginning ,  the atmosphere was welcoming and comforting for our dog .  they use all natural products .  when we picked up our pup she was happy ,  smelled amazing ,  and looked so good well groomed .  our dog doesn ' t like her paws being touched ,  and they did a great job getting her nails trimmed up with a method that helped our dog stay more relaxed !  couldn ' t be more happy ! 
__label__5 probably the best hotel i ' ve stayed at .  i received the military discount and this is the best discount on a hotel i ' ve ever received .   this place is a modern luxury masterpiece .  the rooms ,  elevators and building itself is immaculate .   everyone was very nice and the staff was super friendly as well .   the rooftop bar was pretty awesome as well .   overall ,  great hotel and this will always be my number one hotel to stay at when i am back home in cleveland ! 
__label__4 big fan of nourish .  the menu changes daily and also can be viewed online at nourishcleveland . com  when you walk into nourish .  .  .  .  . starbucks on your right .  salad bar is always clean and two different soups every day .  anything from seafood chowder ,  asian root veggie stew to split pea .  when you have to go to the same place for lunch because you don ' t want to walk outside in crappy cleveland weather .  .  .  .  . variety rules .    they serve breakfast as well as main course for lunch ,  pizza ,  good earth grill and the deli .  they have pre made wraps but you can also have the person custom your own wrap .  the food quality is very good and the people are always nice .   nutritional value is also posted by the daily food choices . 
__label__5 perfect secret meeting place .  very cool ambiance .  came to meet my friend after work and we were able to have a private conversation in a cool and home-like setting while drinking perfectly made cocktails .  not for the sophomoric drinkers ,  this place has cocktails for someone who appreciates the process and intricacies of their flavors .  also not for the hungry: nothing really to eat past a cheese plate .  go here for intimate conversation and drinking ! 
__label__4 i ' ve been coming here for a few years now every time my tire light goes off  ( so about ,  2-3 times a year ,  usually at the ends of the cold season )  .  there ' s one guy who almost always happens to be there and he cheerfully helps me add air to my tires without a scowl .  it ' s great because despite being taught a zillion times how to add air to my tires ,  i still can ' t get it .  this time ,  my tire pressure gauge was malfunctioning .  ugh .  anyway ,  the air is free ,  and the staff is great .  i usually try to buy something from their convenience store in return as a thanks .   the only reason it gets one star off is i would love to buy gas from them since it ' s super close by ,  but the prices are usually some 25-30c more expensive per gallon than other places nearby . 
__label__4 nice people !   good service !   expensive gas  ( but i don ' t buy gas often ,  so i still go there anyway )  . 
__label__5 something different ,  and definitely worth doing !    we took the introduction class which seemed a little expensive at the time ,  but after taking was more than worth it .  in that class you work one solid piece ,  and two blown pieces .  our instructor mike was very pleasant to work with and a very good teacher .  everyone there is very nice including the rooster that strolls around the shop .  it takes a little time to get used to the process of gathering ,  blowing ,  and rolling ,  but they are very patient allowing you to get pretty hands on .    i would definitely recommend .  .  . just be sure to wear something light as you will be in front of a pretty hot furnace for a while . 
__label__5 they offer gluten free cupcakes and cookies .  the cupcakes are always fresh and very pretty great flavors and designs
__label__4 i went here a couple of times and tried their espresso ,  grasshopper ,  salted caramel cupcakes .  .  it ' s a cute boutique place located in tremont and the prices are reasonable  ( $2 . 50 )  and they even make wedding cakes .  the cakes are moist and rich in flavor .    so if you ' re ever in the neighborhood ,  this is a great place to go for some sweets .  no complaints and to be honest ,   i would go regardless if i ' m in the neighborhood or not .  i haven ' t had one bad experience except maybe their salted caramel because literally there ' s salt sprinkled on top of this one .  maybe i picked the wrong one but overall ,  it ' s good . 
__label__5 fast ,  friendly ,  lots of options ,  and literally the best chilli i ' ve ever had .  this place would make cincinnati ashamed to call themselves the chilli capital of america . 
__label__4 my boyfriend and i stopped into paloookaville on a blustery sunday afternoon and left warm and satisfied .   we got a sampler of chilis and sides  ( we had a groupon )  and enjoyed them all .  texas chili ,  paneer chili ,  apple coleslaw and the adobo chips were standouts .  it was also great to wash everything down with an ibc root beer .   i ' d like to go back and try some of their sandwiches and chili nachos .   i had to call to find out to find out their hours because the website is under construction .  we also discovered that they will be open for dinner come march 2012 .    overall ,  a great little neighborhood place with affordable prices and yummy ,  unique chili that will warm even the coldest of winter days .   will be back . 
__label__5 wow !   we had a great lunch here !   we had the texas beef chili and the chicken chili - both on hotdogs with cheese ,  onions ,  and sour cream !   what a great addition to the restaurant scene in cleveland - and it is definitely a cleveland joint !   check it out ! 
__label__5 i pass this place every day and finally stop and was so happy to do so !  the environment was great with art covering the walls and connected to a vintage clothing shop with a beautiful dog .  i had the texas chili as i was in no mood for beans and it was amazing .  had a little bit of a kick and so did the cornbread with what i think were little chunks of green peppers baked in .  also a very green environment as well .  if you dine in they use real bowls and everything else was recyclable .  the only piece of trash i had left was a napkin .  very reasonably priced as well .  if you are in the area this is a must try spot ! 
__label__5 chilli is excellent .  i get mine in a burrito .  very friendly staff . 
__label__2 ate lunch here in sept . ; arrived at noon ,  a half hour past the listed opening time .   ordered one of the chilies ,  don ' t remember which one .   the chili was spicy hot but the temp was just luke warm .   staff seemed a little disorganized . 
__label__4 this is pretty typical potbelly fare .  large chain ,  university circle location so it gets crowded at lunch ,  but they keep the line going quickly .   the staff here were very pleasant and helpful .  i had the mushroom melt ,  a staple on any potbelly menu .  the sandwich came out quickly and tasted delicious and very similar to the other mushroom melts i ' ve had in the past .   in particular ,  this location has some beautiful artwork and photography on the walls that i appreciate .    tip for case students and residents: free fountain beverages on wednesday with a case id !  this may become my wednesday lunch spot when i have time to take a lunch ! 
__label__5 one of the best sandwich places i ' ve ever been to .  if you ' re hungry be sure to go with the larger sandwich option ,  it ' s not that big at all .  the addition of avocados is a must with the grilled chicken and cheddar sandwich .  the peppers add a nice zesty taste to the sandwich as well .    being from the west coast haven ' t ever come across potbelly but if i ever travel east again it ' ll be a must-eat spot . 
__label__1 walked by - was afraid i was gonna get shot .  .  .  .   turns out someone did later that night . 
__label__4 i ' m no expert on indian cuisine ,  but everything i ' ve had from indian flame was consistently delicious .  the lunch buffet is a good deal if you want to try a variety of things and have a big appetite .  prices are relatively low ,  but not dirt-cheap .   the biggest downside is the service .  the employees always seem disgruntled at having a customer in their restaurant ,  and it can be very off-putting .    personally ,  i ' d check out an online menu ,  and order takeout .  it ' s reasonably fast and minimizes awkward unhappy employee interaction . 
__label__3 the way i think of indian flame is this: in america ,  we ' ve got our local pizzerias and fast food places where we can pop in ,  grab our normal ,  unspectacular ,  but reliable meals .  well ,  pretend for a second we are in india  ( and they have tje same proclivity for fast food )  .  .  . indian flame would be your destination .  it isn ' t trying to hide anything or be more than it really is .  rather ,  it ' s a "hey .  .  . i ' m making indian food ,  want some ? " approach .    you aren ' t coming here for a date or to spend excess amount of time .  rather ,  if you have a tooth for indian and don ' t want to make a big deal of the situation ,  you know you can count on what this restaurant provides: food ,  not a dining experience .   the decor is decent ,  though you might find yourself staring at the bright paint colors for a while ,  but if you ' re like me ,  you probably won ' t mind .   dinner menu is larger than you ' d think ,  given the cafeteria feel to the place and the small number of tables .   you really can ' t beat the lunch buffet price  ( though ,  you can probably easily beat the selection and quality .  .  . on the salty side too )  !   the one downside to the "hey we ' re making indian food ,  want any" approach is that the service leaves much to be desired: your drink will not be refilled unless you call a server over to help .   this is about as far east as you ' ll want to be on euclid .  .  . some shady things went down the first time i was there . 
__label__5 lunch buffet was affordable and delicious ,  i loved everything they put out ,  will totally go back ! 
__label__5 now if you are accustom to buying off the rack at one of the many retail clothing stores and being satisfied with the way you look and how your clothes fit then christophier custom clothing store is not the place for you .  but if making a fashion statement and being able to turn every head in the room when you walk into it with all eyes on you because your attire is a total knock out then this place is for you .  mr maurice ' s attention to detail from head to toe along with his personalized service ,  phenomenal fabric selection and all custom made to make the most finicky customer look and feel fantastic .                                                                                                                                             i would like to thank mr maurice for his continued help and patience over the years on making and keeping my dearly beloved man looking like he just stepped out of gq magazine .                                i absolutely love this place !  highly recommended  ! 
__label__2 really unimpressed .    they phoned up to cancel my appointment the morning of and i had to phone back and reschedule .   second time they did actually see me ,  and i ordered a year ' s supply of contact lenses from them to be delivered to my house .  the lenses never showed ,  and when i phoned back a couple weeks later to find out what happened they told me the supplier said they ' d been delivered and there was nothing they could do .  i should "take it up with the post office . " no tracking numbers or anything and they wouldn ' t give me contact info for the supplier .   eta: the lenses did suddenly turn up months later  ( november i think ?  )  .  so not a scam ,  just unreliable .  .  .  i hear from the company that they were changing suppliers ,  which was maybe the problem .  i hope that the systems have gotten figured out now and things are better going forward . 
__label__1 my mother went in the day before a scheduled appt to check out the surroundings .  she was treated not so nice .  as my mother walked past the different technicians and spoke she was instead greeted with blank stares .  the women never spoke back and instead just looked at my mother with the look of  ( what on earth are you doing here ) we decided to cancel her appt .  i must say ruby the receptionist was very friendly and sweet .  .  .  ruby was the reason i decided to make the appt .  in the first place .  the actual technicians were the reason i canceled . 
__label__5 stopped in on a whim .   such an adorable space .   relaxing and wonderful women .   loved my pedicure .   highly recommend . 
__label__1 i was not impressed .   coupling with the nostalgia of a steelworks is a workable idea but compared with pittsburgh ' s waterfront this mall falls far short .   as a pittsburgher who grew up in cleveland ,  i think cleveland could do much better and has in other venues .   this was disappointing .   note that all my pictures are of the adjacent mill  ( old j&l )  which was much more interesting ! 
__label__4 this is the only taco bell within decent distance of university circle ,  so naturally ,  this location gets super overwhelmed at the drive-through .  it ' s also in east cleveland ,  but that never stopped anyone before .   i ' ve seen huge lines for the drive-through ,  but they get through it in 10 minutes .  it ' s a sight to see .   and the food ?  it ' s taco bell .  it ' s just fine .  i ' ve never had bad food or an order mixup come from here ,  so it deserves my high marks . 
__label__1 today we waited at the drive through for 15 minutes ,  and we were only the 3rd car in line .  we placed our order  ( under $10 )  ,  and then waited another 15 min to pull up to the second window and get our food .  when we pulled up to the window ,  we were told that their card machine was down .  we didn ' t have cash ,  so they informed us that we could not get our food .  if we had had a larger order or we had been informed before we placed our order about the credit issue ,  i would have understood .  however ,  to make someone wait 30 min and then refuse them food because of an issue on the restaurant end is ,  in my view ,  ridiculous .  will not be going to this taco bell again . 
__label__2 i really don ' t have too much to say about this place .  .  .  it ' s kmart .   you all know what kmart is .   i ' ve never been inside of a super kmart before .  .  .  it ' s pretty much the same as a super walmart or a much less classy super target .   the prices are decent ,  and i might shop here from time to time if the place was closer .   the reason we went here ,  however ,  was to find some a cheap ,  relatively temporary table for the dining room .   luckily ,  we were able to find something that suits our needs for much lower than anywhere else .   why only 2 stars then ?   i know this is kmart ,  but the service here is just plain embarrassing .   does anybody work here ?   anybody at all ?   it took us over an hour to find someone that was willing to go into the back and bring out the table we wanted to buy .  .  .  after asking a few people who were supposed to send someone back ,  and then trying to use the telephone station to call for help ,  which was conveniently missing a telephone .   i don ' t expect much from a place like kmart ,  but this was unacceptable . 
__label__2 store is cool .  staff is not .  it ' s a shame this is the store that sells cleveland gear ,  because they are a poor representation of the vibe of the city .   the only thing more obnoxious than the staff is their hair .  take your money to someone who appreciates it ,  this place gives shopping local a bad reputation . 
__label__4 mmmmmm .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . shredded chicken enchiladas covered in mole sauce .   only $2 and great with a small cup of joe from city roast .   the freshly made chips and large variety of salsas are some of the best in town !   but i think the mole will always be muy favorito ! 
__label__5 my fiance and i stumbled upon orale ' s looking for a filling friday night meal .  the scallops on the outside menu caught my eye and i knew i had to try them .  the staff was very friendly and informative and provided excellent service .  with endless salsa ,  some of the best jumbo sea scallops i ' ve ever had ,  and the guajillo pepper and orange glazed grilled salmon ,  we were left truly satisfied with our choice in dinner .  the pricing was unbeatable ,  you can ' t go wrong with jumbo sea scallops for $12 .  my fiance and i are also pretty peculiar when it comes to salmon ,  it was excellent and cooked wonderfully .  the chef even came and introduced himself to us to ask how our meal was .  we will definitely be returning here soon .  check out my photo of the jumbo sea scallops ,  if i haven ' t emphasized them enough ,  they were fantastic ! 
__label__5 super tiny little joint with super informal ,  friendly service that makes you feel that you ' re eating at a friend ' s house .  .  .  .  .  . drinks are awesome ,  try the blood orange margarita-delicious !  !  !  !  the app prices almost equal the entree prices which is weird because you get so much food on the plate for an entree ,  but the appetizers are teeny tiny .  .  .  .  . but delicious none the less .  we had the chorizo empanadas and smoked chicken taquitos for apps .  .  .  . both delicious but we all agreed that the taquitos were the  better of the 2 .  for dinner 3 of the 4 of us had tacos .  .  .  .  . battered avocado ,  mahi and carne asada tacos were the 3 choices .  .  .  . i had the chile rubbed pork chop smothered with mushrooms and served with purple potato mashed stuffed with goat cheese .  the chop was fred flintstone-esque !  so huge !  !  we all agreed that any place else would have charged at least $30 for this pork chop compared to the meager $15 charged here .  .  .  .  . believe me ,  i ' m not complaining ,  i am happy to get away with the 15 dollar price .  .  we all agreed that we ' d happily come back .  food and service is wonderful ,  paintings on wall are really great and the vibe is fun and friendly .  .  .  .  .  . go and try this place out !  !  !  ! 
__label__4 orale has a stand in the westside market ,  but also has a brick and mortar restaurant .  they offer an excellent vegan menu on tuesdays ,  and the regular menu always has a handful of vegetarian /  vegan options !  plus ,  you can sample a variety of salsas with your meal at no additional cost !   orale is certainly on my top 10 vegan-friendly place to try in cleveland !  http: /  / veganhostess . com / vegan-cleveland-restaurants-coffee-shops-more / 
__label__4 it ' s places like this that make you want to live in tremont .   first off it was a cold ,  rainy night ,  i was starving and really wanted a beer .   i decided earlier in the day i wanted to try something new but with a laid back ,  relaxing kind of feel .   i couldn ' t have been more happy with my experience at prosperity ' s last night .   i already checked out the photos on their website and on yelp ,  along with the appetizer menu ,  so i knew what i was getting myself into .   i had my eyes on the 2 dozen mussels for $8 . 50 and the pierogies for the same .   my partner in crime decided on the hummus .   and of course no experience would be complete without trying their rotating seasonal .   i know this was going to be a 4 star place the minute i noticed the bells brown they had on tap ,  one of my favorite beers from bells brewery in kalamazoo michigan .   service was great .   cute ,  timid bartender was all over our every need .   beer was always full and the food was piping hot when it came out ,  not heat lamp hot either .   the mussels were simple but delicious .   not a single one cracked ,  empty ,  or still closed .   one of the only places i ' ve been to that can get that right .   the pierogies were very good .   i never had ricotta filled ones but it added a little sweetness that went well with the butter soaked onions and sour cream .    finally i have to say i am a hater of chick peas ,  too dry and not much taste ,  and this hatred kind of followed in line with hummus .   i ' ve tried it at different places and just was not a fan .   but the trooper that i am ,  gave the psc hummus a try and actually went back for more .   smoother then all other hummus i had and they mix in fresh herbs with good olive oil that came through in the taste .   the pita crisps are actually crisp and not impossible to spread the hummus on .   also came with cucumbers ,  kalamata olives ,  and tomatoes .     about the bar .   long bar ,  pool table ,  old school bowling game ,  small bathrooms ,  great jukebox  ( put $5 in when we got there )  ,  but the thing that stands out is the decor .   antique ,  full working condition ,  schlitz globes were the star attraction .   i also liked the fact that they had a disco ball going at all times ,  with a little saturday night fever from the jukebox it just sets the scene for a party ready to break loose .   unfortunately ,  we only got some head bobs to george clinton and ice cube ' s hardly ever played 1993 hit bop gun .   how fun .   i will definitely go back .   it might not be right away only because there are so many restaurants i want to try in the area .   i may come back and adjust my rating once i know what i ' m comparing to in close vicinity but my first intuition is to make prosperity a 5 but we ' ll see .   fyi - i took a picture of their happy hour menu but am having a problem downloading it but will keep trying .   you can always go to their website though .   they also have all day specials ,  thursday was a $10 strip steak and fries ,  good deal if i ' ve ever heard of one . 
__label__4 i recently took my first visit to prosperity ,  after hearing nothing but good things from friends .   after a busy day ,  the bf and i didn ' t want to go home to cook ,  found ourself near prosperity and decided to stop in for the last 30 minutes of happy hour  ( 4-7 m-th ,  4-6 fri )  .    draft beers were $1 off ,  so i chose a dogfish head 60 minute ipa from the decent but small selection .  the bf got a bottle of pyramid apricot wheat  ( not a hh special but fairly priced a $4 . 50 )  .    for food ,  we split a dozen mussels  ( $3 hh )  -- a bit on the fishy side ,  but in a garlicy ,  buttery broth that was great for dipping the accompanying bread in .   ( yes ,  bread was included in the hh portion - a nice surprise .  )   i also had an order of vegetarian stuffed grape leaves  ( $5 hh )  .  though good ,  these were a bit bland and ,  for lack of a better descriptor from memory ,  wet .  however ,  they were served with sliced cucumbers ,  tomato ,  feta  ( which ,  let ' s face it ,  makes almost anything measurably better )  and toasted pita .  it was a satisfying and filling-enough spread for the price .   the bf had a heartbreaker burger ,  topped with banana peppers ,  gruyuere and a fried egg ,  and served with fries for $10 . 50  ( not a hh special )  .  he said it was good ,  though not as good as the burger at lava lounge one block away .   ( which he has deemed the best burger he ' s ever eaten .  )  i stole a few fries ,  which were okay but greasy and a little cold .  however ,  served with malt vinegar ,  which is worth extra points  ( just like the feta )  .    in short ,  the food overall is average ,  which is tough to justify  in tremont ,  where so many excellent options abound .  however:  the atmosphere was fabulous .  vintage beer and liquor memorabilia line the walls and dangle from the ceiling .  a small disco ball spins in the corner .  there is an inviting pool table in the back .  music during our stay featured elvis costello ,  the ramones and the violent femmes ,  among others .   the service was quality .  our bartender was kind ,  helpful and attentive without being overbearing .  only downside was that the bf received a juice-sized glass  ( maybe 6 oz )  with his bottles of beer rather than a pint glass .   ( i will never understand why bars do this .  )   the people seem to really make this place something special .  regulars abound and strike up conversations with employees .  a lone diner at the bar near us struck up a conversation that started with beer and ended with mr .  show and mary lynn rajskub .  i hope we run into him again .   i expect that i will return to prosperity ,  often even .  i will try other food options -- possibly the veggie empenadas ,  which sound tasty and our new bar-friend vouched for .  i also want to try one if the "prosperitini" offerings ,  most of which looked tasty and are $2 off their standard $9 or $9 . 50 during happy hour .    mostly though ,  i ' ll go for the vibe and the company . 
__label__5 happy hour ,  ftw .  try the blackened shrimp taco ,  it ' s delicious !  old world night is on wednesdays ,  see you out here ! 
__label__4 love this place .   staff can be a little curt sometimes so that ' s why 4 / 5 .   food is delicious and i love the cozy setting . 
__label__4 don ' t get me wrong ,  i love going to the pretentious restaurants in tremont -- admiring the dishes that look like beautiful works of art and cocktails dreamed up by mixologists all the while listening to people at adjoining tables debate what is required for the perfect brunch or talk about their recent work in france .  but sometimes i want to relax in a more casual atmosphere while still enjoying food that doesn ' t insult my senses  ( ok ,  that sounded pretentious )  .  and in tremont ,  one of those place is prosperity social club .  jeannene and i were there on thursday and it really is the perfect spot for a rainy autumn evening .  drinking old-fashioneds  ( no special ingredients -- just the classics )  and listening to old men at the bar talk about what osu needs to do to win it all this year ,  we settled into a table where i could see a couple of tvs tuned to espn and tmc ,  i think .  as for the food ,  i think it was actually better than i remember .  our appetizer was the potato pancakes with apple and cranberry chutney  ( $9 )  and there wasn ' t anything fancy to it -- three dense pancakes with a thick chutney that came with a bit of a kick to it .   as for the main courses ,  i had the fish fry  ( $14 )  which came with several pieces of battered whitefish and thick-cut sweet potato fries .  the batter on the fish was unbelievable light though i probably should have used the salt shaker on the whole dish .  jeannene ordered the pork loin  ( $15 )  that came wrapped in bacon on a mound of smashed potatoes and spinach .  i tried a bite when it arrived and then spent most of the meal figuring out how soon i could get back here to order it myself .  the pork was a moist medium well and the thick-cut bacon was nice and crisp to give the dish some bite and the potatoes were just the thing for a cold rainy autumn evening .  we skipped dessert though the bread pudding sounded perfect for the weather .  this is the type of place where every aspect is 3 stars but when combined it generates a truly 4-star experience on a non-pretentious evening . 
__label__5 i have not had the food ,  except that once i had a piece of cheesecake there and it was perfectly tasty .   i have had the drinks ,  from wine to a fancy bailey ' s-ish dessert drink ,  and they were excellent .    and i have seen the delightfully laid back vintage-midwest decor ,  and experienced the mellow ,  spacious vibe .  heard the good music they play  ( an entire arcade fire album the last time i was in there )  and the wacky old movies that are on  ( butterlies are free .  )  been recipient of the friendly service .  marvelled at the size of the place--that just couldn ' t happen in san francisco .   great bar that makes me miss the midwest . 
__label__5 i love this place .  they have everything for the home ,  new or old .   they do a great job copying keys .   i took a key to 5 other places .  this is the only place that could copy it right .   they are a little pricey ,  but are local and seem to have everything ,  including the old stuff . 
__label__4 sign up for their website ,  they are constantly have contests and sending coupons .  i like their chicken teriyaki ,  cheesesteaks and this is one of the few places to get fries with your sandwich in solon . 
__label__4 after a late morning at moca ,  we headed to little italy and presti ' s .  this is a great lunch spot for people with diverse tastes as there is everything from pizza ,  to pastas , salads and panininis .  all reasonably priced ,  with a great selection from their bakery for desert .   ( hint: save room for creme brulee )  .  it can get a bit crowded at lunch and be sure to take a number as they use them ,  and won ' t get around to you as fast if you just stand in line .  yes ,  it ' s a bit confusing ,  but that ' s part of the fun .  they bring the food to your table and you bus your plates once you have finished . 
__label__5 their food is excellent .  i ' m from san francisco and whenever i ' m in town i try and visit . 
__label__5 we just got done with dinner at parallax saturday night and the server brought over a dessert menu ,  but all of a sudden one of our friends said he would be right back .  he walked over to cookie and a cupcake and brought us all back cupcakes  !  he was familiar with this place because they ordered there wedding cupcakes from here .  we were pleasantly surprised at how amazing the cupcakes were .  the german chocolate ,  peanut butter and red velvet were all amazing as i had sampled both .  i will come back here again and am considering ordering these for future events .  being pregnant this is a must stop for your sweet cravings  !  !  !  !  !  ! 
__label__2 i ' m a bit of a cupcake lover and have been for quite a long time now .  these were mediocre at best - i was disappointed .    the actual cake was a little bit dry .  the custards / fillings weren ' t as flavorful as i was hoping they would be to offset the cake texture .  honestly ,  i ' d rather get the cupcakes at dave ' s supermarket than have these again .   i live in the oc neighborhood of cleveland and absolutely love living here - the search for great cupcakes nearby will have to continue .   i had the vanilla - which is my absolute favorite normally .  the icing and vanilla flavor itself were underwhelming .  i also had the apple which another reviewer recommended and disliked that one .  i couldn ' t even tell what the filling was supposed to be ?  the strawberry sits in the fridge while i work up the nerve to try the last flavor i bought today . 
__label__5 i got cupcakes from a cookie & a cupcake for my sister ' s bridal shower and i was definitely impressed !    i ' m originally from the cleveland area ,  but i moved to d . c .  a few years back ,  so i ' m used to paying inflated prices for cupcakes .  with that in mind ,  i think the prices at a cookie & a cupcake were on point ,  but i could see how one could think they ' re a little pricey .    on to the product-the cupcakes were great; the cake was moist; the frosting was good and the fillings were excellent .  additionally ,  particularly compared to other similarly-priced cupcakes ,  they were generously sized .   another plus was the great customer service-the ladies who run the shop were pleasant on the phone and were able to make a "custom topping" of two fondant hearts on top of each cupcake for a small additional fee .  i recognize that most people  ( myself included )  don ' t like the taste of fondant and wound up removing the hearts ,  but they definitely looked good !   the shop itself is cute ,  as well .  additionally ,  they have a small picnic table out front that would be a fun place to sit and enjoy your cupcakes on a nice day .   overall ,  i ' d highly recommend a cookie & a cupcake ,  whether it ' s for cupcakes for an event or just to stop in and grab a treat . 
__label__5 loved the person working and loved both cupcakes !   i had chocolate chocolate and the signature . 
__label__4 if you ' re in the tremont area you have to stop by here for some treats !  cupcakes started as a trend but now they are here to stay !    even if you are not a coffee lover ,  i urge you to try the espresso cupcake !  it ' s chocolate cake with caramel mousse an coffee butter cream !   it is such an amazing combination of flavors ,  i ' m glad i live 45 min away from this place because i ' d be at least 800 thousand  pounds by now !    don ' t forget about the pb lovers and the grasshopper either ! 
__label__4 we popped in before dinner and got 4 cupcakes .  the salted caramel ,  a carrot cake ,  a chocolate one ,  and their special one with a cookie on top .  initially we were concerned that most of them had some sort of filling inside but this really just ended up being a "moist maker" for the cupcake .  2 days later they were still moist and yummy .  too bad cleveland is so far away ! 
__label__4 i think mini-cupcakes should be a bigger trend .   i want to try all of them here ,  but have only had a couple .   i think the place is super cute ,   ( cute=small )  but it ' s maybe a bit overrated .   each time i ' ve come here ,  there are a lot of empty holes where cupcakes should be .   like carrot cake cupcake .   i ' d do that .   maybe i don ' t have the sweetest tooth ,  so i ' ll add a star for them . 
__label__1 guuuuuh .  .  .  . not priced competitively ,  grimy and disheveled .  .  . i ' ve come here a couple of times in the past but not for a year or so and now i know why i don ' t stop in more often .  .  . 
__label__2 this store is a reminder that the planet is at max capacity and human beings love to collect a bunch of stuff to fill the void in their souls that make life feel meaningless .  buy a bunch of things and feel purpose .  it is the american way .  the shelves are made out of cinder blocks which is a nice urban chic touch . 
__label__2 easily the g . e .  with the scarcest selection in a five mile radius .   the store is always clean and the staff is adequately attentive .   i stop here when it ' s a matter of convenience  ( on my way home )  or last minute items .   not much else to say ,  it ' s a grocery store . 
__label__3 just noticed i checked in at the wrong location .  i ' ve been to this giant eagle before and it has always had a weird old smell .  i was writing a review for the one on 117th .  i much prefer that location over this one
__label__4 i had biscuit & gravy with chicken for sunday brunch .  good service and the food was delicious .  i will definitely be back . 
__label__3 stopped for a nightcap with friends and family and to get something small to eat .  must try the mac and cheese was very delicious . 
__label__5 the best fish fry !  welcoming ,  efficient service and an excellent bar .  .  .  what more could you ask for ? 
__label__2 it was overpriced for the quality of the food we got .  sausage gravy breakfast was very bland with lazy man hash brown .  chicken sunshine salad was nothing special for 11$  ( throwing in spinach ,  pre made dry chicken ,  mandarin orange from a can ) 
__label__5 came here after my flight got delayed 5 hours .  everyone was really friendly and service was pretty quick too .  i ' m not sure what it was called but we split a burger that had mushrooms and fried onions on it .  it was amazing .  they also have this really cool old school bowling game .  i would def recommend this place . 
__label__4 great brunch spot !  i went here last week and it was pretty delicious and affordable for the amount of food that i got .  staff is super welcoming and hard-working . 
__label__3 the name of this pub came off as somewhat pretentious to me so i was quite hesitant to come here at first .  however ,  i ' m glad i did check it out because it was far from that !  i came here a couple of nights ago with a large group for dinner .  the pub was very accommodating and reserved the back room tables for us .  we ordered a bunch of different appetizers to share:  - spinach and artichoke dip: very flavorful !  definitely want to get these again !   - fried oysters: i ' ve never imagined fried oysters to taste this good .  the sauce was absolutely amazing !   - potato pancakes: simply lovely !  i love the tangy sauce that came with it !   - pierogies: not very impressed by these !  a little too expensive for the portion size .  - mussels: also not very impressed by these .   for my entree ,  i got the reuben pancake ,  which i was not very pleased with .  i normally love reuben sandwiches ,  but i think this place made it a bit too sour .  the pancakes that came with it were also a little burnt .    overall ,  i ' m fairly satisfied with the appetizers but not so much the entree .  would probably come back again to try out their drinks ! 
__label__4 i have low expectation of fast food at sport event as most of them are overpriced for mediocre food .  but b spot really exceeded my expectation .   4 star for their burgers at around $10 ,  probably the best deal at the q .  freshly made and so tasty .  and you can top it up with as much or as little condiments at the station was a plus .   lola fries  ( $4 . 75 )  was a little disappointing over seasoned non crispy matchstick fries .  i would suggest just order another burger : )  .   drinks pricing same as every single vendor inside the stadium .  $4 . 25 for a bottle of water ?  !  soda for $4 . 75 .  .  .  beer for $8 . 25 and up .  just painfully expensive !    just eat another burger .  . 
__label__5 best coffee house on the east side of cle .   great location too on a small side street in little italy .   cafe latte every time with carrot cake .   they also give you a separate sparking soda water which cleanses the palate between coffee sips .  i am going there this morning now that i think about how good it is : ) 
__label__5 full disclaimer: i don ' t drink coffee .  but i bring all my coffee-drinking friends here when they are visiting .  they have all been very impressed with their beverages .    my other reason for posting this review is because of the waffle guy that comes on sundays  ( euro-waffle bar )  .  for $8-10 i can get the most delicious waffle i ' ve ever had in the us .  it ' s dense and rich and filling .  there is always an assortment of fruits ,  sauces ,  and toppings to choose from .  some perfect examples  ( not all together ,  people ,  get a hold of yourselves !  ) : bacon ,  raspberries ,  bananas ,  strawberries ,  nutella ,  carmel ,  whipped cream ,  ferrero rocher ,  cookie butter ,  fudge ,  and i am sure others that i just haven ' t gotten to yet !  i am so glad this is right down the street . 
__label__4 so this coffee is a little on the pricey side .  but if you ' re a huge coffee snob - as my sidekick is - you will love the taste .  delicious every time .  : ) 
__label__5 great place to to get a beard trim , haircut ,  ect .  very professional and knowledgeable staff .  then treat yourself to a drink upstairs at the speakeasy . 
__label__1 the most unprofessional experience i have had in cleveland .  ordered for delivery and was told it would take about an hour .  1 hour and 40 minutes later still no food .  when i called to request an amount of time they told me that they would refund my money .  when i asked what had happened they began yelling at me and hung up .  i called back to ask if they were still going to attempt to deliver my food and the worker yelled that they would refund my money and hung up again .  previously i was never called to say whether my food had arrived or that it would not be delivered .  i was shocked and surprised by how they handled all sides of the situation .  very unprofessional and very rude .  disappointed that i was not able to find my place for chinese delivery or take out in cleveland .  any recommendations ? 
__label__5 great veggie burger .  homemade black bean patties .  service can be slow but the food is always good and the staff is friendly . 
__label__5 if you ' re in cleveland and in need of a beer ,  well ,  "you better call saul" !   great bar ,  great prices ,  good craft beer selection on tap ,  better than average menus ,  perfect place to party before or after a cavaliers game .  saul is a really personable bartender .  felt fortunate to stumble upon it .  you could do a lot worse and spend a lot more in cleveland .  give this place a shot . 
__label__5 great little bar in a good location .  a few blocks from playhouse square ,  good live music  ( at least on weekends ,  anyway )  ,  good food ,  and a good beer selection .  my kind of place . 
__label__2 terrible service .  didn ' t have the full menu .  got my drink wrong .  got the drink of the person behind me wrong .  got the sandwich of the person in front of me wrong .  not a good experience . 
__label__5 i grew up in this theater seeing the most popular of shows here .  in the past 20 years ,  the theater hasn ' t really changed and that ' s something cleveland should take pride in .  most of the broadway shows are performed in the palace theater and the stage has seen the likes of names such as frank sinatra ,  bob hope ,  the three stooges and even houdini .    you can take tours of the theater during the day and if you ever get the chance take a ghost tour of this theater ,  you ' ll hear some pretty crazy stories .  i got to sleep on the stage once with girl scouts and it was the creepiest and most exciting sleepover i ' ve ever been too .  visit and wonder in the majestics of this glorious 1920 ' s theater .  oh and yes the ceiling really is painted with gold . 
__label__5 i always feel like statler and waldorf  ( the guys who sit on the balcony in the muppets )  when i am here .  i have seen some great shows at the palace theatre .  most recently i saw the book of mormon .  i thought it was overrated .  one of my biggest regrets in life was not "indulging" when i saw cheech and chong on their up in smoke tour a few years back .  the guy eric l .  is right about the seats being small and uncomfortable . 
__label__5 last night my fianci and i went to see the trailer park boys and it was our first time at this theatre .  an employee asked to see or tickets halfway through the show because it seemed we were double booked for seats ,  she never returned with our tickets and when my fianci went looking for them  ( we wanted to keep them for a scrapbook )  she wasn ' t anywhere to be found ,  so he asked another worker  ( i ' m assuming the manager or owner )  and that gentlemen handed us the presidential loge seats and we were able to sit in the best seats in the house for the rest of the show .  this was unexpected and soooo amazing !  !  after this ,  my blood sugar dropped dangerously low  ( i ' m a type 1 diabetic )  and i had forgotten my glucose tablets so we asked an employee if she knew where i could find a sprite since the bars were closed in the theatre .  she ran back to her bag and gave me her nutrigrain bar .  this meant so much to me and was incredibly sweet .  i didn ' t catch her name and i wish i had .  this place is wonderful and we will definitely recommend it !  the hospitality at this center is beyond amazing ! 
__label__4 i ' d  give this place 5 stars for the food quality !  always delicious .  obviously you can ' t beat a $5 pizza !  could be in a better location .  or even better yet closer to my house since our local store closed .  i now drive 20-30 min for pizza .  lame ! 
__label__4 i ' m so glad i discovered this place !   but caveat:  bikram yoga is not for everyone .   i got into "the habit"  ( and yes ,  it ' s kind of addicting )  at the bikram yoga harlem in nyc and i crave the heat and love to sweat .   if breaking into a sweat ,  makes you all hot and bothered  ( pun intended )  this place is not for you .   this is a place for people who can handle the heat  ( no pun at all ,  just the simple truth )  .     your first time at bikram yoga ,  three things are bound to happen: 1 )  you will feel like you are going to throw up .   it ' s okay .   i ' ve only ever seen one person actually throw up .  2 )  you will feel like you are having a heart attack .   i still haven ' t seen anyone do this although i feel like maybe i ' ve gotten pretty close a few times  ( usually when i ' ve been out drinking and carrying on the night before .   when this feeling hits ,  the best thing is just to sit your butt down  ( head held above your heart )  and think happy thoughts of "this too shall pass . "  works for me .   3 )  you might have an existential crisis .   different people will deal with this in different ways .   i just tell myself to get over myself .   seems to work .   about this location:  i ' ve been a few times and it was the same teacher .   she is great ,  cute east european accent and i like her matter of fact manner of leading the class .   no bs ,  no snobbery ,  no judgment ,  just getting you to a melting point .   i also like that ,  unlike the classes i took in nyc ,  this place isn ' t crowded  ( perhaps i shouldn ' t be writing such things on yelp !  )  .     my one complaint:  can we please please please have soap in the showers ?   first time i went ,  i thought they were temporarily out of soap ,  but second time ,  the soap dispensers had been removed !  !    after sweating heavily for 90 minutes ,  i would please like to wash "all my areas" with some soap .   it doesn ' t have to be fancy soap ,  i ' ll take softsoap . 
__label__4 i was so excited to see that there is finally a bikram ' s yoga in cleveland  !   i did bikram ' s yoga for about 8 years in another city and it was a loss when i moved here  ( see my previous "yoga tour" reviews )  .   in fact ,  i was so inspired ,  that i ' m writing my first yelp review after months .     the instruction here is quite good ,  especially danielle ,  who is kind ,  cheerful and inspiring even amidst 100 degree heat .   she makes you believe that yes ,  you really can and yes ,  you even want to do that insane yoga posture : )  .   i like that it ' s more low key than other bikrams i have done in the past ,  where i pushed myself into injury .   no worries of that here  !   one further thing i like is that the business seems to be owned and operated by young women  !   yeah  !   my one and only complaint ,  and i deducted a star for this ,  is the carpet in the studio ,  which is left soggy ,  sopping wet under the sweat of other students .   come to the first class of the day if you can or bring an exceptionally large towel so you do not ever ,  ever have to leave your mat .   and please ,  please ,  byc ,  please reconsider this carpet decision . 
__label__4 was in town on business so did my usual studio check in .  .  .  .  have to have my bikram fix .   first impressions were a very nice studio with waiting area ,  ample coat and shoe area .   great bathroom space with 3 toilets and 3 showers -- how luxurious to have so much space !   everything in bathrooms and waiting area and all was very clean and neat .     staff was very friendly and helpful .   enjoyed the instructor .   she was great with help and advice on each pose ,  but not overly personalized ,  calling people out often .   its nice to have correction when you ' re doing something wrong ,  but not to be scared that you ' re always going to be corrected when you ' re just not pushing as hard .   it was a great balance .   as for the actual studio - ah - i forget the smell of bikram .   i personally don ' t have a problem with a little bikram smell ,  but i know a lot of times people slam bikram studios for the smell .   so - don ' t come in and expect not to have a smell in the studio - but know that its not that bad - i ' ve smelled way worse .   i ' ve either been going to studios that are brand new or studios that have hardwood floors  ( which ,  fyi ,  is technically not "technically" bikram rules )  so you kind of forget the sweaty ,  steamed carpet smell .   honestly ,  for me though ,  its a smell that i ' ve become fond of .   i did find it a little different that the lines on the carpet were actually laid in black tape rather than actually "painted" on the carpet .   not a problem though .   my only complaint was that ,  at the noon class ,  the carpet was pretty visibly dirty .   when we got to floor poses ,  i would touch the carpet and i ' d always come up with hair  ( not mine )  .   i could see specks of stuff all over .   i didn ' t feel grossed out or anything because it wasn ' t ground in dirty or anything - just figured it could have used a vacuum or something .   i only put the "complaints" in as i know there are some people who come to bikram and are horrified by the smell and all - its normal and this studio is completely a normal studio - i ' ve been in bad smelling ,  and this was not .     that being said - give it a chance .   if you ' ve not done bikram - you definitely need to try it .   staff is patient and they ' ll help you get through .   if you ' re a bikram junky - a good studio to practice at ! 
__label__4 tried this pizza for the first time ,  got their ohio city favorite which consists of provolone ,  romano & cheddar cheese ,  bacon and onions with red sauce ,  large pizza and was $18 . 50 .  it does seem a bit expensive but the pizza was delicious .  we picked up the pizza ,  it ' s a small place ,  you can eat there but it seems like the majority of their business is carry out or delivery .  will definitely eat this pizza again . 
__label__4 i ' m giving this joint an extra star ,  since friggin domino ' s won ' t deliver to ohio city .   went here on my first night as a resident of ohio .  the gal behind the counter was really sweet ,  she greeted us all warmly and ended up talking with my stepmother for about ten minutes .   the pizza was good .  no problems .  not spectacular ,  but .  .  . after a while ,  spectacular pizza grows a bit tiresome .  this is good pizza ,  will fill you up ,  and doesn ' t cost a ton .  it ' s perfect for where it is  ( which is a 3-5 minute walk from my house .  .  . which is great )  .   hopefully ,  the snobs on the other side of lorain won ' t force them to change their name  ( i ' ve been informed ,  quite snottily ,  that i don ' t live in ohio city .  .  . folks north of lorain avenue almost have a stroke if you suggest that south of lorain is also ohio city )  .   either way ,  they have pizza .  .  . it ' s not crappy ny style ,  it ' s actually decent  ( yes ,  i ' ve been to all the ny pizza joints ,  tried it all )  .  they have coca-cola .  you don ' t need much else for a pizza joint . 
__label__3 mmm .  .  .   pizza and sweat .   the up-side: the pizza here is pretty good .   the down-side:  questionable surroundings .   in the summer i ' ve watched giant beads of glistening sweat roll off the male cook ' s head and nearly splash land on my pizza .   thus ,  i never go in summer any longer .   the sum-it-up:  eh .   not bad but a little gross at times .   sorta like all of ohio city .    ( and i can say that  ' cuz i ' m from here .  ) 
__label__4 this pizza is so consistently good !  for specialty pizza ,  i go to edisons in tremont .  but when i want a good pizza without the extra bells and whistles this is easily my favorite spot in cle .  they never fail !  ! 
__label__5 i love the pizza and the quick delivery !  the girl who answers the phone is the rudest person i have ever spoke to .  she must be related to someone .  .  .  . it ' s the only explanation as to why she still has a job ! 
__label__5 best pizza in cleveland .  the sauce is savory and the cheese is thick .  great crispy crust .  amazing price . 
__label__1 i ' ve tried giving them a few chances every time  i ' m just super disappointed .  bad pizza and bad customer service when i tried calling to complaint
__label__1 don ' t ask for cash back on the weekend .  they will lie to you and tell you their system is broken when in reality they don ' t want to give cash back because eat at joe ' s next door only takes cash .  i get it ,  but huge inconvenience for actual customers ,  and no need to lie .  i just checked out at the pharmacy at the back of the store and got cash back ,  which is how i know they were lying and why they wouldn ' t give me cash back . 
__label__1 i am a veteran with a 3 week old infant .  my wife and i wanted to go see the patriotic movie  ' 13 hours '  and was told we were not a loud in with our child even though there was hardly anyone at the 1pm showing .   he was asleep and we would have obviously taken him out of he got upset .    i ' ll never go to this theater again or recommend it to anyone .  go see movies at a place that shows a little more respect for veterans . 
__label__3 guacamole gets an a+ !  !  !  !  big avocado hunks and lots of lime .  very flavorful and comes with plenty of yummy chips .    tried a fish taco and the mole .  both were b- tacos .  i know my way around a fish taco and geeze was i disappointed .  i got the mole to try something different and it was highly suggested .  i felt that it lacked in taco accessories and was mainly a big glob of meat .  also none of the hot sauces were spicy at all .   the spicy margarita was really good and well made .  price was right and maybe even on the cheap side since it was in a big mason jar .   has a different feel than other taco places .  .  .  tex mex vibe was unique and welcomed .  location is good too .  the service was also really great . 
__label__5 loved this place .  our waitress  ( i wish i remembered her name )  was awesome .  i loved the whole indoor / outdoor vibe and this style of mexican is my favourite .  the place was full and vibe was great on a friday night .  they had the game on too so bar area was full .  we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table but that ' s not crazy .   everyone in my group loved their cocktails .  the chips and various salsas were delicious .  i could literally drink the salsa verde .   the tacos we tried all delicious .   if i ' m back in cleveland i ' d definitively stop here again . 
__label__5 service was great .  food was awesome .  matt aka chewy was our waiter ( ask him to do the chewy noise ,  it ' s on point  )  long long list of tequila and whiskeys as well as beer on tap .  really cool environment .  super clean and crisp with sharp looking design . 
__label__4 my family & i came for lunch and had an awesome meal .  after having the guac & chips ,  i had the el pastor  ,  short rib (  not my favorite )   and steak tacos .  the el pastor and steak tacos were extremely flavorful & filling .  we washed it all down with a pitcher of pineapple margarita; amazing  !  not too sweet and not too bitter .  thanks bakersfield for showing this ny girl a different side of cleveland dining
__label__5 best tacos in cleveland .  great prices .  everything made in house .  margaritas are dangerously delicious .  2 pineapple margaritas ,  guacamole and a few short rib tacos will set you right . 
__label__5 what can i say ,  i just think it ' s a perfect place for this area and another great addition to an already great food / drink community in ohio city .  tex mex and a great trendy environment .  so what did i get ?  for drinks pitcher of the spicy margarita ,  and for app i got the queso cooked in cherry with chorizo and jalapeif1o (  taste almost like a beer cheese )  amazing loved that .  and the kicker the short ribs .  .  .  get it !  i got the torta which is a hot sandwich and i would get it again . 
__label__5 i was indeed slightly manic ,  feeling triumphant over my sudden decision to visit a restaurant ,  to which i would usually feel such strong aversion .  i felt prepared for the ride .  though i ' ve had a rough time with taco restaurants several times in the past ,  my last handful of experiences had been quite controlled and delightful ,  almost disappointingly so .  this trend was utterly broken .   within 10 minutes of entering ,  something happened .  i ' m still not quite sure what it was ,  there was some sort of contradiction or impossibility in my conscious experience .   one early event i recall was feeling like there were bits of vomited meat somewhere in my head ,  in a place where there should never be a sense of taste .   i reached out for my trusty bucket that i bring with me to restaurants but then i was overcome with the ridiculous belief that i had already thrown up ,  and was somehow rewinding reality as i reached for my bucket .   from this started my slide into absolute insanity ,  a complete loss of my sense of reality .    my memory faded in and out ,  flashes of salsa ,  bickering housewives ,  beer-gulping drunkards ,  academics ,  margaritas ,  and braised meats appeared and disappeared from my vision for what felt like an eternity .  how and when i got home i do not remember . 
__label__5 this place is amazing .  my husband and i just moved back to cle from nyc and were so concerned there wasn ' t a good eclectic taco place .  the worries are gone !  this place is amazing .  the chips were incredible along with the queso and we loved the tacos and tortas ! awesome ! 
__label__5 stumbled upon bakersfield on ig and decided to have a family date night with my sibs ,  boyfriend and cousin .  to start we got the queso with chorizo on top and it was delish !  warm ,  delish and they slightly brown it on top which i liked .  for our first round of drinks we got a pitcher of the seasonal margarita which was pineapple .  it was a wonderful balance of sweet pineapple flavor and tequila .  loved that the drink was strong but wasn ' t super sweet .  it had just enough flavor to mask the tequila and give that refreshing pineapple / tropical taste .  because there were 5 of us and frankly also because we enjoy margaritas ,  we got two more pitchers - the original margarita and the sangria .  the pineapple was still my favorite !  they also had $5 tequila shot specials so as expected we ordered a couple rounds of those as well .    tacos were great !  i ' m used to barrio portion sizes so i ordered two tacos but ended up getting one more because they ' re on the smaller side .  i got the bistec ,  cochinita pibil and pollo rojo .  i eyed the menu prior to coming and had my heart set on the short rib taco but they were out so i guess i just have to go back .  oh the torture haha .  everyone else in my party enjoyed their tacos as well and had no complaints .    okay so now the most important aspect of a dining experience in my opinion - the service .  service was excellent .  we went later on a friday night and it wasn ' t too crowded .  they cleaned off a table for us right away but a couple of us wanted a booth instead and they were more than willing to accommodate us .  our server scott was wonderful .  he was very attentive and he joked with us throughout the night .  loved the vibe and dicor .  my boyfriend is really into the more rustic look so he loved the pipe door handles and overall dicor of the place .  i thought it was pretty cool too .    overall great experience and we will be back .  hope you ' ll save me some of the short rib tacos ! 
__label__5 hands down the best place for mexican food .  as someone who was born in mexico and raised eating mexican food ,  nothing in the state of ohio has resembled that .  they have the sazif3n and touch of real mexican flavors .  also ,  their service is excellent and the waiters truly respect the culture !  i am deeply satisfied with my experience here .  i strongly urge everyone to try this place and leave what think "mexican" food is behind and open their taste buds to something new that has hit the city of cleveland ,  comida mexicana ! 
__label__5 the food ,  the service and the ambience are all excellent .  can ' t go wrong with texmex food .  they give a verde ,  spicy and a tomato sauce for the tacos .  i took the habanero sauce side for a dollar which is really not required given the sauces provided .   the tacos are around $4 and 2-3 are good enough .  the mole taco was delicious with the right amount of sweetness .  the pollo rojo was good but i liked the mole better .  the huitlacoche is difficult on the tongue to pronounce but yummy on the palate .   the milanesa torta was humongous it tasted really good either verde sauce and the habanero sauce .   bakersfield margarita was strong and adequate .   another choice of texmex to compete with the bombas and barrios
__label__1 greeted rudely by the owner from the time we walked in .  waitress was rude .  there was a big fight because of a waitress and other waitresses jumped in to argue with customers !  they don ' t not like to service people of color in here !  will not return ! 
__label__3 a strange giant eagle indeed .  it ' s set up better than perhaps all other giant eagles i ' ve been to .  like ,  you don ' t have to walk through unnecessary stuff to get to where you want to go .  and the flow of the store makes sense  .  .  .  if that makes sense  ( which it probably doesn ' t unless you have a weird mind like i do )  .  i like how the pharmacy and cards are sort of in this section in the middle ,  so that ,  while it ' s prominent and easily accessible ,  it also doesn ' t get n the way of anything because the aisles are shortened in those areas .   the negative ?  the slowessssst checkout ever !  !  long lines and no room to stand .  it was to a point where i actually had to back up my aisle and turn into a different aisle in order to get in line for a cashier because nobody could move their carts .  fortunately ,  this was only an issue for about 10 minutes ,  as some new lines opened up just as it was getting ridiculous .  if it happens again i will not return !  but this means i gotta give it one more try . 
__label__5 i come in often and stopped in last week to buy tea .  they have a great selection and good pricing compared to big box retailers .  i can only drink herbal teas and they have a good selection .  happy colada is my favorite .   you can buy it in bulk or get a glass to go .  they have discounts if you buy in bulk .  they also sell tea equipment . 
__label__5 i finally stopped in last week after months of walking by on a daily basis .  i am so glad i did - this place is fantastic !  the girl working that day was so knowledgeable and helped me pick out a new tea to try based on another blend that i already knew i liked .  the happy colada is delicious and refreshing .   they sell tea strainers of various sizes .  i picked one up for work for $3 .    it is awesome to see so many cool places filling in the arcade ! 
__label__3 way !  too much money for this joint .  on a positive note the wagu filet was superior and they serve their steaks with thin fried onion rings that replaces bread just perfectly .  that steak was worth the trip .   but ,  soggy bread ,  potato gratin had too much of a bite ,  the corn pudding was shoe peg  and they had quit cleaning the bathroom at 8 pm so you suffer the atrocities from the drunk patrons attending a group outing .   i ' m sorry but when dinner for two is over $350 . 00  ( $100 for two steaks )  then you pay for a clean bathroom ,  fresh bread ,  perfect potatoes and basically you better get it right . 
__label__5 we went for my sister ' s bachelorette party dinner and had the best service !  the food was amazing !  !  they definitely made the occasion feel very special for us and we greatly appreciated it . 
__label__5 best steakhouse in cleveland in my honest opinion .  the prezel bread is like anything else in the world .  the has stayed the same for decades and had never failed to impress .  i have been to hyde parks for a multitude of occations .  everything from business gatherings to bachelor party dinners .  just simply a terrific place . 
__label__3 nice place .   i ' d like to give it 3 . 5 stars .  .  .   steak and sides were very good  ( 40 day dry aged ribeye and corn )  - the food  ( other than the bread )  was 5 stars - couldn ' t be better .     the service ,  however ,  was mediocre .   the waiter was very friendly ,  yet completely unattentive . 
__label__4 location: good downtown location ,  easy to find .  we used the valet parking across the street at tower city center for $12  ambience: warm dark woods ,  and multiple small eating areas provide an intimate setting .  the buidling once housed a bank ,  hense the huge safe that still sits downs the hall .    menu: consists primarily of soups ,  salads ,  gourmet burgers ,  beef dishes ,  fish and chicken .    service: eight of us went to hyde park on a tuesday afternoon for an 11:30 reservation .  we were seated promptly and menus / drink were brought immediately .  we ordered our food in a timely manner but it seemed to take awhile to get our food .  and it really took a long time get our desserts .  however ,  the wait staff were courteous and attentive and we hardly noticed they were there .  it is hard to say if the place was busy or not because there are so many separate rooms where the customers remain hidden from view .   food: the bread they serve while guests are waiting for their food is out of this world good .  who doesn ' t love warm pretzel bread with melted butter ?  yum .  i orderd the lobster bisque soup ,  a 6 oz .  beef filet ,  and squash .  unfortunately the soup was barely warm but the waiter promptly took it away and brought a new steaming bowl .  wow ,  it was creamy and perfect .  there wasn ' t a drop left after i finished with it .  my 6 ounce petite beef filet was done as orderd - medium rare .  it was just a tad on the dry side ,  though and it could have been juicier .  still ,  the flavor and spices were wonderful .  my side veggie ,  squash ,  was buttery and seasoned just right and was a nice accompaniment .    dessert ,  let me tell ya ,  they have a creme brulee that was so decadently creamy it almost knocked by pantyhose off .  the fired crust on top combined with the creaminess of the brulee was magnificent .    value: this was a work lunch so i didn ' t have to pay for it .  the entree itself was about $22 and i imagine the desserts ran about $8 - $10 each .  i ' m fairly cheap so i couldnt '  imagine paying these prices myself so i can ' t comment on how i personlly feel about the  value .  but ,  if you want a high-class ,  gentlemanly place ,  this is it . 
__label__5 by far this was one of the best dinners we have eaten out .  the staff was friendly and attentive ,  although the bar bartender wasn ' t as attentive as she should have been it took a while to get a drink although there was only 5 others at the bar .  the food was wonderful !  steaks were cooked as ordered and the flavor was fabulous .  we will be back ! 
__label__2 to say this theater is old may be a understatement .  this place could almost be a museum .  the building itself is actually kinda cool and harkens back to a era when movies would have been referred to as talkies .  besides its dilapidated and grimy state it ' s fairly well run .  the concessions stand was pumping out snacks quickly and the ticket counter was easy to reach by phone when i called and processed the line quickly enough when we arrived .  .  .  . one of the biggest downsides was the auditorium we went into .  the first set of seats we tried were broken off their stands and would just about dump you in the floor .  all of the other seats were positioned in a "bolt upright" position .  crapped seating aside the most annoying feature was that the actual screen was positioned at about a 75 degree angle to the seats .  i ' m not talking about the normal concave arrangement that most theaters have ,  this one actually had you facing the left edge of the screen no matter where you sat .  it was funny to see how all of the regulars sat entirely on the right had side of the theater to avoid having to spend the movie looking / turning to slightly to their right just to see the screen dead on .  very annoying .  i ' ll try and skip this place if i ' m ever in the area again . 
__label__3 we decided to go out on a date last night and see guardians of the galaxy 2 .    the staff was great !  funny and made me laugh .  however ,  everything was incredibly over priced .  we got 2 beers and a pretzel and paid $25 .  not only that but ,  they didn ' t bother to give us a box .  so ,  we ' re trying to walk up stairs with glasses of beer ,  a pretzel ,  cheese ,  our 3d glasses and a bottle of water .  it wasn ' t very convenient .    when we got into the actual theater .  the floors were so sticky ,  i actually came out of my shoes twice !  that ' s kind of icky .  the light was so bright ,  we needed to sit near the front row just to be able to see the screen without a glare .   but ,  the floors were absolutely filthy !  !  like ,  sticky and crunchy .  almost like they haven ' t been cleaned in a long while .  we like this theater because we can order beer .  but ,  for $20 for 2 tickets ,  then $25 for beverages .  we kind of expected it to be clean .  unsure if we ' ll be back . 
__label__5 updating because i ' ve been regularly coming here for almost 3 months now and my experiences have only been better .  all the instructors are so knowledgable ,  helpful ,  and friendly .  i look forward to coming to class every day .  no matter your level of experience ,  they have classes for everyone .  cannot recommend enough ! 
__label__5 lovely and welcoming studio just a few minutes walk from the famed westside market .   got to have an excellent friday flow class with the owner theresa .   much needed for this la girl visiting !   thanks again . 
__label__5 i really like places that cater to men .  this studio offers a male only beginner ' s yoga class on tuesday nights from 8-9pm .  there were about 5 others in the class .  the teacher ,  theresa ,  is great .  she is a good mannered ,  gentle instructor and her directions are easy for newbies to follow  ( not bogged down in technical sanskrit terms )  .  i recommend trying out her studio for all genders .  if you don ' t have a mat no problem ,  there are good quality mats available to use  ( and no worries on them being clean there is spray provided too )  .  there is also water provided - bring a bottle .  the studio is located in a great upstairs space above the ohio city bars  ( entrance on w25th st and the east part of bridge ave )  .  street parking or park for free in the west side market lot behind all the stores on the east of w25th . 
__label__5 my husband and i were looking for a farmers market for fresh ,  organic food and produce .  we came across the grocery on yelp and decided to go .  the owner took care of us ,  she was very nice and passionate about what she sells .  i enjoyed a green juice and then bought a kale bowl to take home for dinner .  my husband bought a sandwich and chicken noodle soup .  we also bought the frozen apple chicken patties to eat tomorrow for dinner .  so far we ate the bowl ,  juice ,  sandwich and soup and they were absolutely delicious !  i wish this store was next to my house ,  i would come every single week !  5 stars for sure ! 
__label__5 i came back for a to-go breakfast wrap and coffee this past week was so ,  so pleased with her fresh take on this handheld am meal .    first ,  i just want to say i wasn ' t the only one taking advantage of the grocery ' s new breakfast .  i watched a gent park right up front ,  order a breakfast wrap ,  pay and get back in his car in under 5 minutes .  no processed crap ,  just a freshly-made ,  locally-sourced healthy breakfast prepared just for him ,  fast .    i let the owner ,  rachel ,  take creative freedom with my wrap while i sipped my six shooter ,  locally-roasted ,  expertly made coffee .  scrambled eggs ,  scape ,  tomato ,  spinach ,  pepper jack cheese all wrapped up in what looked like a wheat wrap ,  then toasted on outside .  the best part ?  all the ingredients  ( minus the wrap and cheese )  were locally-sourced .  the other items were probably organic ,  but i didn ' t ask .  i just ate it .  and it was so good .    stop in if you ' re looking for a quick ,  healthy breakfast or lunch ! 
__label__4 love the concept and selection and i hope people patronize this place .   but the majority of the items in this place are what you find at local farmers '  markets ,  west side market ,  and other purveyors in ohio city and other small ,  boutique businesses .    am i really going to buy fresh produce ,  pope ' s bbq sauce ,  rising star coffee ,  and ohio city pasta here ?   nope .   i prefer the charm of buying these items direct from the producer but that ' s just me .   again ,  love the concept and i hope the place does well .   cute interior and the in-house made sandwiches and kombucha look great .   cool idea to offer bulk grains ,  too ,  without having to go to whole foods for them ! 
__label__1 walked in 20 minutes before close and was told "we don ' t have any more pizza . "  in the 3 minutes we were there ,  we watched the employee behind the counter turn away 3 other customers .  great business model . 
__label__1 awful service .  don ' t go here unless you want to leave extremely unhappy .  avoid !  avoid . 
__label__4 love this place !  they change flavors often and always offer samples .  much better than menchies . 
__label__5 this is the only fro-yo place downtown .  it ' s in a college student populated area .  there is a pizza hut ,  arby ' s ,  an indian restaurant ,  and a few other places right on the same vicinity .    street parking can be a hassle but worth it .  lemonberry is very clean and you notice that the minute you walk in through the door .  vibrant and fun decor invites you in along with the girls working there who offer to sample you some flavors .   they have about 12-15 flavors ,  something for everyone .  they have a ton of toppings ,  no complaints there either !    pricing is fair and based on weight .  my friend got a full cup to the top ,  and i ,  a half cup full .  our total was about $10 for both . 
__label__5 i love voinovich park !   i think this is the best place to take pictures of the skyline .  it ' s so picturesque .  i like to bike down there .   never have been to any of the festivals but i hear its a great venue .   beautiful place to visit !  !  !  ! 
__label__4 voinovich park is a hidden gem in downtown cleveland .  located at the end of the pier behind the rock hall ,  it has stunning views of both the city and sunsets over the lake .  the park is open late ,  and has a guard ,  which may make some people feel more comfortable due to its downtown location .  it ' s perfect for an afternoon stroll ,  or a picnic after visiting the rock hall or great lakes science center . 
__label__5 huge fan of these sandwiches .  when i ' m looking for something quick near my place this is my favorite option .  recommend over the many various chain sandwich places nearby
__label__4 i ' m not a member and i ' m not a boater ,  so maybe i have no business writing a review ,  but i won ' t let that stop me .  :- )   a friend of mine is a member and every time i go ,  i ' m struck by the friendliness and utter lack of pretension here .  drinks are stiff  ( albeit made with paramount well )  .  the food isn ' t great but the setting is .  in the unlikely event that i ever had a boat ,  this is the kind of place i ' d keep it . 
__label__4 great spot to grab a comedy show !   this is apparently their new location ,  which is beautiful .   nice big bar inside ,  and the showroom is nice too .   they have a great beer and martini selection ,  and a full menu .   we had the southwest chicken panini with sweet potato fries  ( delicious )  ,  the chicken quesadilla  ( pretty good )  ,  and the chicken fingers  ( pretty horrible ,  do not order )  .   we saw loni love and the lovers ,  and they were great .   overall a great night out in cleveland . 
__label__5 love love love !  !  five guys hits the right stop after a night out or if you are in the mood for a juicy burger that is made and not frozen and reheated .  the standard burger is two patties and than you add your toppings .  i usually get the little burger which is one patty .  you can get a medium fry and split with two people .  the portions are huge !  !  the service is quick and great !  i recommend five guys for a tasty meal when you are not on a diet .  best part they have complimentatry peanuts to munch on while you wait for your meal to be completed . 
__label__1 their slush machine was broken almost all summer .  i went elsewhere to get my freezes . 
__label__5 great place for parties .   good food .   nice club .   they always remember my name
__label__4 the club at key center offeres two key things i was looking for in downtown cleveland .   they have a wonderful workout facility with great staff and kind clientele ,  and they offer the social aspect i was looking for in a city club .   the pub upstairs is wonderful place to grab a quick bite ,  or drinks after work - and the dining room serves as a great place to have a more formal dinner or to entertain .     in terms of the social aspect ,  we frequent the cooking glasses ,  3 , 4 , 5 meal specials in the pub ,  wine tastings ,  special events and networking happy hrs .     the athletic floor has plenty of machines ,  free weights ,  pool ,  classes  ( yoga ,  zumba ,  spin  .  .  .  etc )  - and spacious locker room facilities .     this is a membership based facility ,  but they tend to run special promotions for young professionals . 
__label__5 i found this restaurant thanks to yelp .  lived in cleveland a number of years without ever knowing it was here ,  called for a reservation and talking with junior was like making a new friend on the phone .   arrived hungry at 3 when they opened with no preconceived ideas ,  which i recommend all first-time diners do here .  you know about the relaxed atmosphere and long wait so don ' t come and then complain on yelp .   had planned to have gumbo ,  etouffee and jambalaya but ended up with chicken remoulade and jambalaya .  i had to close my eyes when i tasted both as it was so good i ' d only dreamed of cajun / creole food being so delectable .   did not order any alcohol .  i wanted to stay on my chair !  nor did we have rum cake .  couldn ' t hold another bite .   junior ' s place is larger than a reviewer mentioned  ( 5 tables .  )  it could easily hold 25 diners and a group will make for a fun time .  this wonderful man cares deeply about his food ,  his restaurant and his guests .  i admire him for who he is and what he does . 
__label__5 like cajun food ?  never had cajun food ?  you need to try this restaurant .  seriously .  do it .    this could be my favorite restaurant in cleveland .  it ' s that good .  a small place ,  run by junior  ( owner / operator / cook / bartender )  the atmosphere is casual ,  with a stopping by a friend ' s house kind of vibe .  it ' s relaxed in a way that would normally annoy me  ( food can be slow for sure )  but it ' s really just that southern attitude .  my best advice ,  just order a drink ,  sit back and let the food get there when it does .  it will be worth the wait .   the food itself ,  is amazing .  nothing on the menu has been a disappointment to me .  crispy fried fish ,  delicious po-boys ,  red beans and rice ,  the whole list is done well ,  with a homemade feel .  the jambalaya is as good as i have ever had .  i have gone just to get that by itself .  i highly recommend you try it .    the only real downside is that it is a little pricey ,  but it ' s not enough to drop my opinion from 5 stars ,  simply because the quality of the food ,  and the atmosphere in the restaurant warrant the cost . 
__label__4 good portions .  decent broth .  fair price . 
__label__4 really good pho .  the broth is perfect .  noodles were also perfect i noticed ninh kieu is the only one of four pho places in cleveland that has the tiny sauce saucers stacked on the table ,  good sign of things to come .  my wife ordered the bun bo hue and noticed the bean sprouts also included banana blossoms ,  nice touch .  the add on veggies for my pho were all pretty fresh ,  and included the slender herbal spiky leaf ,  of which i don ' t know the name .  it ' s rare even in california where there are tons of pho joints .  my only disappointment came when i discovered that my pho contained no tendon .  a component that i was really looking forward to .  the other day my wife had pho at another place and was plagued by her "msg" headaches later that evening .  no "msg" headache tonight !  another good point for ninh kieu .  cleveland ' s lucky to have a really good pho restaurant .  the only thing c needs now is a good bowl of ramen . 
__label__5 best banh mi in cleveland .   had the spicy soup and it was heavenly .   fantastic place in a great location .   updated inside ,  so it looks very nice .   i consider this a must go place in cleveland for vietnamese . 
__label__5 recent ownership change this past year .  definitely one of the best vietnamese restaurants in cleveland now .  their pho is on par with superior pho with bigger portions of noodle and meat .  $1 more gets you an xl .  they also have very good  ' bun '  which is the noodle salad and the meat selections are tasty . 
__label__3 i can only review cleveland as a tourist based on my short visit to the city .   i found the city quite tourist friendly with a decent public transportation that i can use during my stay .  it is always nice to able to have a pint or 2 and without worrying how to get back to my hotel .    people were pretty friendly .  i though a little confused with the empty roads and trains even at rush hour .  everywhere was never too busy .  maybe i came from bigger cities where everywhere was jam packed with people and cars .   having  nba ,  nfl and mlb teams .   sport fans would not be disappointed as it is always fun to catch a good game .    beers and more beers ?  !  a week long cleveland beer weeks ?    there are also some nice interesting restaurants for some decent meals at a good price point .   hotel rates downtown though was really pricey ,  probably due to supply and demand as there are not too many downtown .  but as long as you stayed in one of the hotels near red line ,  then it is easy for you to get down with just 1 train .    cleveland is not a big option for a weekend stay or a mini getaway .  but may not be a "destination" as a vacation hot spot . 
__label__2 ice cream tastes great .  .  .  .  but when i drive half way across town because i hear that a place is amazing and don ' t get what i pay for it ' s a huge disappointment .  we waited in line for about 15 minutes .  then it took more than 10 minutes to make my ice cream .  after all of that i didn ' t even  get a full hurricane .  after asking of i could get mines full like everyone else i was told no because it was made correctly and they wouldn ' t remake it or add more .  very rudely !   the service was unprofessional and i refuse to spend money where my service is not appreciated .   i ' ll try the northfield location if i ever decide to try it again .   it really is a shame because the ice cream was tasty .  bad service always ruins the experience for me no matter how good the product is . 
__label__2 i ' ve been here twice .  i gave it a second time because the reviews are positive and i thought it might have been an off night .    went for the 99 cent steak night .  that ' s your first warning !  it was a real thin ,  gristly piece of meat .  i think it could have been briefly grilled but then heated in a microwave .  the cocktails are good .  there are security cameras everywhere .  i got pierogies .  they were pretty good . 
__label__4 what a fun and great everybody bar .  i caught up with a few friends from tremont that i had not spoken to in a while .  they voted we head to p for a night cap and some bored games .  the outside patio was super cute and fun but it got a bit chilly so we went inside to warm up .  it happened to be the bar ' s anniversary so there was an array of free food which was all good .    as for menu and pricing .  everything was fairly moderate with a good beer and booze selection .  i did order the spinach dip which was soooo good !  !  !    i would def recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a chill atmosphere during the art walks or recently moved to the lincoln park area of tremont . 
__label__5 the most welcoming and essentially cleveland spot i have visited in some time .   my friend and i stopped in for a friday lunch fish fry .  i sampled my friend ' s fish ,  but was only allowed two bites ,  because it was a crisp and delicious haddock ,  better than any other local fish fry we have tried .   i had the portobello sandwich .  it sounds like a healthy choice ,  and it is , but the kitchen has made this option a comfort food .    the house made chips served with both dishes were crisp and good ,  but ever so slightly under seasoned .   the conviviality of prosperity was enhanced during our visit because they were hosting a wedding at the same time .  the fact that our orders came out promptly ,  and so well speaks volumes about the efficacy of what is reported to be a small kitchen . 
__label__4 this place is what i imagine an old school true neighborhood bar looking and feeling like .  wood bar and wood panelling .  simple tables and simple to no decor .  tables and bar stools don ' t turn over that much .  that said there was no wait for a table and we sat there chilling for three hours without preventing other people who were coming in from sitting right away .  the staff was really friendly and welcoming .    for my first time here i went for brunch .  the brunch menu really intrigued me .  there were definitely uncommon dishes on the menu .  not just eggs done up in fancy ways ,  but truly unique foods that i haven ' t seen on brunch menus anywhere else .  i ordered one of these ,  the wake-up call empanadas .  this dish was served on an oval plate covered in breakfast potatoes .  on top of the potatoes was one decently sized empanada which was stuffed with andouille sausage ,  peppers ,  onions ,  cheddar cheese and egg .  on top of the empanada and the potatoes was drilled a jalapeif1o-smoked cheddar sauce and tequila-lime salsa .  all the flavors blended really well together .  i expected the dish to be hotter / spicer than it was .  it was definitely full of flavor ,  but not hot .    bloody mary ' s are good here as well .  those are actually on the spicy side .  the menu says the mix is a house recipe .    i definitely want to try this place again and try another uncommon brunch dish - i have my eyes on the polish breakfast  ( three potato pierogi ,  kielbaski ,  herbed scrambled eggs ,  bacon and smoked cheddar )  and the c-town sausage sandwich . 
__label__4 i enjoyed the food and the atmosphere is good if a little  ' corporate '  .  they try so hard not to look like a chain style it makes them look like a chain to me .    i wasn ' t thrilled with the tortillas .  no char on them just plain white flour tortillas with minimum cooking .  that may have just been the day we were there .    i thought the food was good but i am with ashley l that they are a little expensive .  there were three of us and we had 8 tacos total and an appetizer and it came to $41 dollars for three of us .  .  . we had water .  if we had  ' mexican cokes '  ,  at $3 dollars each ,  it would have been $50 for lunch without the tip .    i will go back to bakersfield and recommended it to others . 
__label__5 well they just opened yesterday ,  and i was shocked at how smoothly my experience was .  i loved everything i ordered and my margarita was awesome .  the space is super cool and i ' m excited about hanging out here more .   welcome to the neighborhood . 
__label__1 not coming back to this place ,  people are nice and mean well however the the overall experience was not good .    went in to get to my nails done ,  had a only 8-10 bottles of gel polish to choose from .  made an appointment at 4:30 ,  they called and said they were out buying supplies and that they will be back at 5 .    showed up at 5 and no one was there waited 10 minutes finally someone opened the door .  didn ' t actually start getting my nails done until 6 ,  my friend went before me and it took forever .  there was only one person doing the nails .    i starting feeling bad for the girl because she kept messing up on my polish and had to start over ,  didn ' t seem too experienced .    the worst part was had to get my nails redone at another place because the polish was lumpy and parts were falling off .  when i went to the new nail salon ,  they were very worried about what the previous place put on my nails because it actually would not come off ,  had to soak my nails for over 30 mins in acetone and have them sand my nails down to get off the polish .    and at this place it cost 40 bucks to get bad service .  save yourself and do your nails yourself or go to a professional
__label__1 i ' m a big supporter of family owned businesses ,  especially those that have been around for a long time .  i tried to like using this dry cleaner and went several times .  but ,  i just cannot recommend the place .  the last visit i brought in two shirts with chocolate ice cream stains ,  pointed them out to the owner who took copious notes .  the shirts came back with the same stains ,  and the owner did not point out that they could not get them clean .  i ' m not sure they tried .  one of them had the option to hand wash in cold water ,  which i then did ,  and its now good as new .  a third shirt had the color pressed in two different directions !  separately ,  the store is filthy and falling apart .  for the prices they charge they should clean the place and give it a fresh coat of paint .  and ,  if they cannot adequately clean an item ,  they should acknowledge it .   finally ,  the folks that run the place are less than friendly .  this is a customer service business ,  and they largely lack that skill .   i will not return . 
__label__1 terrible .  outrageous prices .  they did an awful job cleaning my shirts ,  i swear they were cleaner before i brought them in .  when i complained i was told they came in that way .  never bring your clothes there ! 
__label__1 this might hurt a bit .   if i could give a half a star ,  i would .  and that would only be for the apology we received after an awful visit .    first ,  i ' d like to preface this review with the fact that the only reason myxx even got a chance from me was a living social coupon .  after reading all of the reviews and passing this place on my jogging route ,  i knew it wasn ' t a hit ,  but i felt like it deserved a chance .  .  .   as soon as we sat down ,  we were greeted by a bartender whom we later learned was a "fill in" and had no idea what he was doing .   ( sorry ,  but i ' m about to be ruthless--this experience was really disappointing .  )  when we didn ' t get cocktail menus ,  i was a little nervous ,  because normally martini bars have drink menus not just so people can see what they have ,  but also to show off what they can serve and what they ' re good at .  we first heard the dreadful words "jolly rancher" when we asked for drink suggestions .  this wasn ' t a certain jolly rancher ,  but all flavors mixed together for a fruit punch jolly rancher ,  which i ' ve never heard of .  my accomplice had the jolly rancher and ,  bless her heart ,  took a brave sip .  and that was it .  luckily ,  i asked for details because fruit punch flavored anything always ends in regurgitation for me .  so ,  in avoidance of a bad experience  ( heh .  .  .  )  ,  i was recommended a raspberry martini .  i ' ll refer to those drinks from now on as the "jolly regurgitation" and "rasp-butt martini" because those were absolutely undrinkable .  what made it worse was that no one seemed to notice or care that we weren ' t touching our drinks at what is  ( as far as i can tell )  aimed to be a cocktail and tapas bar .   when we finally received our food  ( in bits and pieces )  ,  it was thoroughly unimpressive .  the beet salad was served with way too much arugula ,  a strong green that should be used in moderation ,  what we ' re pretty sure were 3 slices of canned beets ,  and some goat cheese water drizzled and hidden underneath the arugula .  boo .  the stuffed pepper was actually pretty good ,  though at this point ,  nothing they could have done would have brought them back from this failure .  since we got our salads first ,  i expected our appetizers shortly afterward ,  but the pepper came mid-salad and when it did ,  we received a "sorry ,  i gave your fries to someone else; don ' t be mad . " and didn ' t see fries for at least another 10-15 minutes .  the fries were sparse .  small thin fries are good ,  but we left hungry--they were intended to be our starchy savior ,  but didn ' t deliver .    luckily ,  we smelled the seafood on another passing plate before ordering some of the enticing seafood appetizers .  seafood should never smell like that .  .  .   as far as the space goes ,  we felt like we were in a school for a holiday party or something .  it was strange .  they really need to break it up somehow ,  but that ' s the least of the issues we encountered here .  also ,  like brandon l .  said ,  the bathroom doors being open was completely disgusting and since we sat at the bar ,  we could see straight into the men ' s room .    like i said ,  we got a nice apology when we were leaving ,  which was appreciated ,  but it seemed like it turned into groveling for customers really quickly .  needless to say ,  i ' m not going to be back ,  no matter how great the coupon is .  with great competition like the fairmount right across the street ,  myxx needs to try a completely different approach or up its game immensely . 
__label__3 cool place to fish .  .  . 
__label__5 best vet i have ever been to ,  i ' ve been to two others .   i live in brunswick and drive there because i don ' t trust any other vet .  they aren ' t quick to always opt for the expensive surgery like other vets are ,  they rather investigate other options .  i have a kerry blue terrier and she is nervous around strangers they take the time to talk to her to make her feel comfortable . 
__label__4 bruegger ' s is a great bagel option that ' s close to my apartment and fairly priced .  i have no idea why i ' m not here at least once a week .  the breakfast bagel sandwiches are delicious and a somewhat healthier  ( or at least it feels like it )  choice than a mcd ' s bagel sandwich .  sure ,  the calorie count is probably up there ,  but the ingredients are fresh ( er )  and not weighed down by grease .    the staff has always been super friendly with me ,  even if my eyes are still half shut and i can ' t seem to get my order out of my mouth in a way that makes any sort of sense .  high five for working the early shift and dealing with sleepy folks and those grumps that haven ' t gotten their coffee yet !    bruegger ' s also runs a lot of coupons ,  and since i ' m a runner ,  i come across them at nearly all of the races i run .  definitely a nice little perk and a great way to motivate me to actually come here as much as my taste buds want me to . 
__label__5 i love the breakfast sandwiches they have here - especially the western .  they also have seasonal specialty flavors of coffee that are always worth trying .  my personal favorite is french toast ,  though you can ' t go wrong with the house blend .  the staff is super friendly and if you come here enough ,  they know your order .  i love coming here to study but often have trouble connecting to the wifi so don ' t count on that .  the outside seating though usually lets you connect to other places wifi though .  they also always have a great playlist playing and i find myself singing along without even realizing
__label__1 terrible over heated and dry .  run to another place
__label__4 this is one of the friendliest bruegger ' s i ' ve ever been to .  the cashier always make conversation with you whenever you ' re waiting to get your food !  i ' m sure you all know what bagels taste like ,  so i won ' t go into excessive details about them .  but i absolutely recommend trying their smoked salmon bagel  ( comes with cream cheese ,  capers ,  onions ,  and tomatoes )  .  it is the yummiest bagel and it ' s a great kick start for your day ! 
__label__4 i was born and raised in cleveland .  .  . but i haven ' t lived there for 20+ years that being said i know good barbeque: )  i was in town for thanksgiving had to have some .  .  . my family picked it up the taste was wonderful and brought back memories i will visit again .  .  . i wonder if they can ship it .  .  .  .  .  . t
__label__5 don ' t know a lot about the waterloo neighborhood but i was starving and wanted to stop someplace in the area .   my trusty yelp app pointed out this place and i ' m glad it did everyone always talks about hot sauce williams and how amazing it is but the ambiance leaves little to be desired .   being dirty is not charming .   it does not add character .  that ' s why i think b&m is better .   everything about this place was surprising in the best possible way .   you can see the smoke as your driving down the street beckoning you to the parking lot .   the smokers are always in action .   as you step out the delicious smell of meat greets you .    you walk in the doors and the place is immaculate .   i mean spotless .   there ' s no place to sit but it ' s designed so you can see what ' s going on in the kitchen through the bulletproof glass .    i tried the chicken wings and the shoulder sandwich .   for about 5 bucks you get a generous portion of deliciously tender shoulder slathered in homemade bbq sauce and covered in slaw .   the bbq sauce was tangy and light and the slaw was the perfect compliment to the shoulder .   the fried chicken wings were big ,  crispy and full of meat .   definitely better than wings from actual wing places .  this was a great experience and i would definitely go out of my way to go here again . 
__label__5 friendly staff ,  great happy hour deals ,  delicious margaritas and food  ( never got anything bad )  .  solid place to go after work .  enough said . 
__label__1 i have no idea how this place has four stars .  the nachos were soupy .  soupy .  how do you even make soupy nachos ?  they had some kind of fake cheese on them .  they were really ,  really terrible .  the chips were stale too .  stale chips !  in a mexican place !  and the drinks were sugary . 
__label__3 overall okay .  not great .  i had the 3 piece perch ,  it was a bit dry; but okay ,  the fries was great .  wife had the chicken philly ,  she said chicken philly was decent; but dry; maybe a special sauce could moisten it up a bit .  i would probably go back for the cheesecake or a steak philly . 
__label__3 let me start by saying if you ' ve been to one liquor store you ' ve been to them all .   with that said what makes this one stand out to me is the location .   you see i have no problem finding alcohol in my neighborhood .   however i typically find that the alcohol in my neighborhood is being sold to me by a bartender or waiter ,  both of whom don ' t take kindly to me taking my beverage to go .    downtown liquor is just the opposite !  they are located less than a block away from my apt and have an awesome selection of beer ,  wine and liquor all available to go !  they will even package your purchases in the infamous "brown bag" made famous by liquor stores world wide .   also they ' re open late  ( i believe until 1am on the weekends though they only sell beer and wine after 10 .  )   this is such a convenience for those nights you may want a drink but don ' t feel like sitting in a bar or restaurant or when entertaining friends and you need to restock your bar before your guest arrive .     on my last trip i noticed a sign stating that they host wine tastings every friday from 5:30-8 with several vendors bringing in their latest products for customers to enjoy .   though i haven ' t been yet i may have to work this in to a future happy hour .   to sum it up downtown liquor is a great place for anyone living downtown to go stock up on all their adult beverage needs .   one side note:  i found it quite odd when i asked the cashier for her opinion on two different vodkas and she responded " i don ' t know i don ' t drink . "  it was like asking a car salesman about a car and him responding " i don ' t know i don ' t drive . "
__label__2 ugh .  the young lady at the front desk obviously doesn ' t want to be there .  i could hear her cursing when she went to get my food .   actually i wish she ' d kept my food .  it was so bland .  no flavor .  hot sour soup wasn ' t spicy at all .  nor the kung pao chicken .  what a disappointment .  i should have stayed with jackie chen ' s down the road .  that ' s what i get for being unfaithful ! 
__label__1 food was good but the delivery man was so rude .  i ordered food from here and 90 minutes later my order finally arrived .  on top of being late ,  the delivery guy screamed at me because he had to drive 14 miles to my house  ( i checked google maps and i only live about 7 miles away )  .  anyway ,  i found his behavior absolutely unacceptable ,  and rude .  it is not my fault management thinks that the distance to my home is acceptable for food delivery .  i would ' ve understood if they ' d called and let me know my address was outside of their area ,  but they did not .  horrible service ,  they really  need some new delivery people . 
__label__5 best chinese spot around period .   i love everything and if you ask her to make it hot she will .   also best spare ribs i have ever had . 
__label__5 love local .   i have been ordering tee ' s from cle for the last 3 years .  .  . and will do so forever !  love them !  and am so excited they are now downtown for my lunch shopping pleasure .  with the holidays and then birthdays i have found myself peruse the store for the perfect cleveland themed gift quite often .  in addition to the clothing and accessories ,  i ' m loving the prints they have in store .    now what makes the experience for me is the service .  when i was in last friday i was helped by a cheerful girl who helped me with my intense indecisiveness .  she was awesome and reminded me to include a gift receipt with my tee .  had a great experience which is so important and sometimes overlooked .   all around great job cle !  !  !  good luck & see you soon ! 
__label__5 this place is great .  creative ,  original t-shirts and merchandise which aren ' t the typical old touristy kind of items .  a very friendly and attentive staff greeted me as i entered and the place was very neat and organized . 
__label__4 the prices are a little high for the quality of the material .  the designs are great .  fun shirts and hats .  we ordered online .  the site was easy and organized .  wishing they had a larger kids selection .  fast delivery .  it ' s just the prices that make me reluctant to shop outside the clearance section . 
__label__4 when it comes to chinese places around the heights area ,  the choices are plenty ,  and trust me i ' ve tried them all .   hunan east has the most authenticity out of all of them .   take a look at their picture menu and be brave ,  otherwise stick to the usual suspects and enjoy .   my staples that you would thing all chinese places would get right are egg drop ,  hot & sour soup ,  crab rangoons ,  and  something standard like a hunan beef or hot pot .   this joint has never let me down .   one item that gets over looked but is a must try ,  pork lo-mein ,  try it ,  its awesome !  !   who really cares if there are fish on the wall ?  ?   the service is great ,  food comes out hot and fast ,  and it seems to be the place to go for the local asian community . 
__label__5 what a gem .  we ordered two seafood orders and vegetable fried rice .  all the ingredients are incredibly fresh .  the portions are gigantic .  everything tasted wonderful . 
__label__2 we drove all the way from westlake to richmond heights bc a friend recommended this restaurant as "the best chinese food they ' ve eatwn" however ,  i must disagree .   i can ignore the  ( scary )  location and the  ( shady looking )  aesthetic of it no problem .  but the menu offers no explanation or ingredients for the dishes so make sure you know exactly what you want .   the food was only so-so .  not worth the drive but edible .  the portions are huge however so that ' s a plus .   some of the staff could use some manners or at least lessons in being polite to customers ,  even if they ' re faking it . 
__label__5 not the best i ' ve ever had  ( having frequented various parts of asia )  ,  but this is the best chinese restaurant in the cleveland area .  period .    my family and i have frequented this restaurant countless times over the past several years .  this is ,  and still is our go-to chinese place when we don ' t feel like cooking at home .    the owners ,  a husband and wife ,  when not manning the front desk ,  can ofttimes be found apron in hand ,  tossing the wok and cooking when the place gets busy .    if you ' re fortunate enough to read chinese ,  get the chinese menu .  if you don ' t ,  do yourself a favour and make a chinese-speaking friend just so you can come back here and order from said chinese menu .    we ' ve brought scores of business guests from across china to this restaurant over the years and they ' ve never failed to be impressed by the quality of the food .  recently ,  one particular guest from szechuan ,  famed for it ' s i-need-a-tongue-transplant-yeah-it ' s-that-spicy hot food ,  commented on how weak a supposedly spicy dish was at blue point grille downtown .  he was brought here ,  the owner specially prepared a chilli pepper & oil-laden dish and .  .  . well ,  let ' s just say those weren ' t just tears of joy he left with . 
__label__5 i ' m giving this restaurant a 5 because although it is not the best chinese restaurant i ' ve ever had  ( granted i grew up in taiwan )  ,  it is the best chinese restaurant in cleveland .  and for that ,  i give it a 5 for being top-notch in cleveland .   don ' t come into this restaurant expecting the best chinese restaurant in the world ,  but if you ' ve only tried food in cleveland ,  then this is the place to go .   overall ,  i do really enjoy their food .  when i go ,  they hand me the chinese menu which has alot more food choices including some reallyy authentic ones .  the food here is as authentic as cleveland asian food goes and it has really authentic food that i wouldn ' t be able to order at liwah or siam cafe .  the other thing i love about this place is the owner is reallyyy friendly and for the price you pay ,  you sure get a huugee serving of food that will last more than a meal !   recommended dishes: i don ' t know if i ' d be able to recommend a specific dish but the one dish i somehow end up ordering there is the baby bamboo with pork dish .  the other one is this noodle soup  ( only on their chinese menu and only served during dinner )  called dai lu mein .    to try for comparison: if you want ,  you can order their general tso ' s or orange chicken .  i usually don ' t order that but all my cleveland friends who have all love their orange chicken and general tsa ' s chicken because there are the chicken aren ' t completely covered in the batter .    least liked dish: the only dish here i ' m not a huge fan of is their beef wide rice noodles .  and honestly ,  i ' m surprised that that is the 1 dish they do not make well there since it is such a common dish  ( you can find it almost at any chinese restaurant ) 
__label__5 picked up take out from here for the first time .  i ' ve known about this place for years and don ' t know what i waited for .  i asked if there was a special and it was a stewed lamb with broad beans and tomatoes .  delicious !  it came with steamed rice and a salad with an excellent dressing and pita bread ,  i can ' t wait to try the rest of the menu . 
__label__4 across from the theaters at playhouse square .   early am visit .   place was rockn '  ,  so were the baristas .   great service ,  good music .   they have a large sitting area on the second floor . 
__label__4 i ' ve been to this starbucks many times to finish some work .  the upstairs seating area is great - lots of seating and tables  ( and a decent amount of outlets )  .  the stairs are somewhat hidden behind the checkout counter .   like others have said ,  the lines here can be pretty long .  but ,  this is to be expected with the store being located in the center of playhouse square .  also ,  this starbucks '  location means parking is a pain - you will likely have to park in a garage nearby .   there are 2 separate bathrooms here ,  one is located opposite the checkout counter while the other is tucked away in the very front of the store .  it ' s a bit of a squeeze to get to this one as there is a high top table somewhat blocking the way .   my drinks have been decent in quality ,  and the staff members were friendly when i placed my orders . 
__label__1 walked in  ( place is empty )  went to the front to look at the menu  ( have trouble seeing from afar )  and immediately barked at by a sloven barista for not  ' standing in the right place ,  and told to go stand over by the register man .  '  told the barista he could keep the damn coffee and walked off .  if you ' re that rude and put off by a customer looking at the menu you don ' t deserve my business and you ' re lucky we ' re in a building with cameras .  terrible ! 
__label__4 cool underground place with live music and fun atmosphere .  moscow mule is a must !  drinks are not very affordable here but the quality  ( may )  makes up for it .   i like that they try to be creative and have different events ! 
__label__5 i love this place !   first time i came was by myself around 11 or so on a friday night .  there was a line and i was first in it ,  but others with reservations of course go in first .  reservations at a bar ?  how cool is that ?  !   so i wait a little ,  in my little black dress ,  getting chilly and whisper to the door guy "hey since i ' m just one i ' m going to sneak in with the next party" he says" yes you are ! " love that man .    so i do ,  leaving a group of four girls who thought they were so cool it was "like embarassing to have to wait " standing there with their chins on the ground .  sorry bitches .    i walk into a super active place with multiple bartenders making prohibition style drinks and a frank sinatra wanna be playing piano .  my kind of place !  !   i find a seat at the bar and order a super cool cocktail i can never remember the name of from a gracious bartender who starts my tab .  fighting off the 20 something year old who thinks an opening line of "nice stems" will get him somewhere i turn on my barstool and check out the crowd .  a nice mix !  mostly classy ,  mostly mature ,  not old ,  just not 20something .    nice stem guy works on my nerves so i move to the other end of the bar where a female bartender does a repeat performance on my uber delicous drink and i mix with some locals ,  the bartender ,  and the super cute barback guy with tattoos ,  geek glasses and a bow tie .    next night ,  saturday night ,  i make reservations for 9:00 as i want to bring a friend and dont want to wait in line .  well ,  there is no line !  in fact there was hardly anyone there .  we stayed a couple hours and still ,  hardly anyone there ,  was very odd but allowed us to experience even better service and drinks then the night before with some cocktail education being thrown in by the tender as well .    i love this place ,  will return everytime i come to town ,  and hope it continues to draw a nice crowd . 
__label__4 my boyfriend is a huge fan of live music and cigars and i love brazilian guitar .  he had never been before and there was a brazilian guitarist playing so i thought it was the perfect time to treat him to a night out .  i love the vibe here !  you feel like you take a step back in time when you enter this modern day speakeasy .  it is dimly light with candles lit everywhere .  i especially love the candles around the piano .  while it is on the smaller side there is plenty of seating available and every time i ' ve gone the service has been good .    there are limited food options so i would eat prior to arriving or as a stop prior to your meal .  the drink list is extensive and a bit pricey but you definitely get what you pay for because the drinks are top notch .  i ' m not a fan of fruity drinks but also don ' t want to feel like i ' m downing rubbing alcohol either so my server suggested the vieux carre which she stated was well-balanced and she was right .  the drink is a combination of rye whisky ,  hennessy and bitters .  while it was boozy the bitters definitely balanced it out and took the edge off .  my boyfriend had the old fashioned with maker ' s mark and enjoyed those as well .    my boyfriend likes to have a cigar every now and then which is another reason why i chose society lounge for date night .  i ' m not too well-versed in the cigar world but he said that their selection was fairly good .  i don ' t remember what cigar he went with though .  the only downfall is that you can ' t smoke inside so in order to enjoy your cigar you have to go outside .  they don ' t really have a patio area either so you just kind of have to stand around and smoke .  plus you miss out on the music and i ' m not sure if you can take your drinks out there with you .    i highly recommend this as a nice spot for date night but if you ' re on a budget like me only expect to have a drink or two .  we ' re planning to go back soon to hear a jazz or blues band . 
__label__5 as you descend the staircase you are transported to a different time .  this classy establishment takes you back to an era filled with jazz and handcrafted cocktails .  my boyfriend and i found ourselves here on a whim and cannot wait to go back .    we looked over the extensive cocktail menu and settled on the monkey gland and boston sour .  outside of my typical drink choice i couldn ' t have been happier with the result .  the best part of the ordering experience was watching the bartenders create these cocktails .  it almost an insult to call them bartenders they are true cocktail artists .    we found a seat at their piano and enjoyed listening to the jazz they had performing .  the ambient lighting ,  soulful sounds and delicious drinks made this a must visit . 
__label__5 nice friendly staff except for the ass manager which was working as a bartender  (  she was egressive )   ,  food recomendation was great by the staff  ,  they had a nice quarter band playing good music  .  .  .  . all in all the place is highly recomended . 
__label__3 went here around 11pm on a pretty busy saturday night .  the area by the bar was busy but there was plenty of space otherwise as long as you didn ' t need a drink .    the drink menu is extensive .  there really are a lot of options .  i tried their cucumber gin drink ,  really pretty  ( served with a cucumber peel )  and good too !  but $14 ?  ?    this is a cool and classy place .  the drinks are good but it ' s just too expensive for regular visits .  the service definitely lacks .  i ' m not sure of its because of how fancy their drinks are or the bartenders themselves but i was not impressed . 
__label__4 a great speakeasy with live music on saturday nights .  a nice location too right on e .  4th where everything is happening .  we enjoyed listening to crooner phil turk all night on saturday .  he was great !  he sings from 9pm to midnight every week .    the drinks were very good  ( a bit pricey )  but good .  the moscow mules were $12 and a beer will cost you $8 .  feels a bit like going out in la but you do pay for a classy venue and live music .  i loved the set up of the bar and that there were a lot of tables and seats for everyone .  we had the best seat in the house on the red velvet couch right in front of the piano .  i would recommend getting there early to secure a spot .  a great place for a date night since it is a cozy and romantic setting ! 
__label__4 a great vibe and atmosphere and the drinks were great ,  albeit a bit on the pricier side .  i enjoy a great classically made cocktail ,   but $12-$14 is a tad on the high end .  great place for a pre-dinner "one" drink . 
__label__2 disclaimer:  the following is my opinion only ,  and yes ,  i ' m a cocktail snob .  sue me .    i ' m sorry society .   i will come back so that you can redeem yourself .  you ' re so new ,  it ' s not your fault .   you haven ' t had time to distinguish yourself yet .   i know the kinks will be ironed out ,  i ' m sure .  it certainly doesn ' t help that i ' m comparing you to ptd / employees only and other various speakeasys / lounges in nyc and manifesto in kcmo .   but good news ,  you ' re the place to be .  i ' ve never seen so many hot scantily-clad platform-wearing ladies on the prowl in cleveland before .  single men ,  this is prime pick up territory .   you ' re welcome .   experience:  experience is what this place is trying to sell you .   the following statement is going to sound ridiculous until you experience it yourself .   outside is a little red carpet ,  a a swanky door man with a red velvet rope ,  and a classy sign .   but once you enter the outside door ,  you encounter the most well light generic office building stairs ever .  it killed the vibe that this place is trying to create .   enter door number two downstairs ,  and you are back into the classy lounge you were seeking with couches ,  tables ,  a piano and a lovely full wall mural .   two ,  the place seemed to be understaffed as i watched waitresses doing their best to accommodate the full house of a saturday night at 9:30pm .   our waitress was timely and sweet ,  given the bustle .   third ,  the lounge singer tried a bit too hard .   he has an excellent voice on his own ,  and he needn ' t push himself for the rat pack style ,  as this bordered on cheesy and sacrificed his actual voice .   kudos to raising the bar and having a live singer though .  anyone can pipe in some music .  at the end of the night ,  your bill arrives tucked away in a cigar box .   note on the ladies '  room:  large ,  pristine ,  excellent lighting and mirrors ,  including a full length mirror if you need one .  bonus !   cocktails:  you must request some luxardo cherries .   they are amazingly good for being a simple cherry .   i started with the matador .   i couldn ' t taste any of the tequila ,  it was smooth ,  bright and quite refreshing ,  very balanced ,  but nothing spectacular .   next i had the singapore sling ,  which was super boozy ,  large ,  also very balanced ,  not too sweet or fruity .   it came with a gratuitous amount of fruit accoutrements as i had hoped .  : )   i also tasted the ramos gin fizz ,  the moscow mule ,  and the monkey gland .  each one was balanced and smooth .   the menu is expansive and full of classics ,  but for a place that wants to be known for cocktails ,  the classics are executed very well but they are too classic for me .   unless a straight up negroni or scofflaw is all you want of course .   i ' ve seen more inventive twists on original cocktails at bottlehouse and the fairmount .   there is room for growth through if society wants to raise the bar for cocktails in cleveland .    cheers ! 
__label__5 i stopped by when i was in cleveland on a visit .  have to say ,  there aren ' t many bars like this .   you could go anywhere to get a crown and coke ,  but if you want something different and that ' s freshly made with real ingredients - then go here .    the bartenders are all fully trained ,  and while it may take a minute to get your drink it ' s well worth the wait .  they create their own in-house cordials / cocktails all from scratch .   they also have a great tapas menu which is perfect for some pre-dinner cocktails and a few apps to get you started for a night out in cle . 
__label__5 society lounge is an amazing venue with great staff .  their menu has always been great !  weekends are filled with live music and an amazing atmosphere .   i love their 4th street sour .  its a perfect signature drink to describe what they encompass . 
__label__4 i was pleasantly surprised by my first visit to asian grille and became a repeat customer .   i was expecting standard chinese-takeout type joint with plastic topped tables and the usual entrees .   instead i found a tastefully decorated ,  dimly lit space that would be great for a casual-but-nice date night or get-together with friends .   i ordered mango fried rice and instead of the usual stir-fry with little chunks of everything throughout ,  got big chunks of mangoes ,  onions ,  pea pods and shrimps with hints of curry and spice ,  and the fried rice serving as more of a sticky binder than the main event .    everything was super fresh and paired with jasmine green tea it went down great .      on other visits i ' ve also had the ginger duck and the sweet and sour dishes and found them to be very fresh as well .   the sauces tend to be thin and flavorful instead of thick and sugary like more standard asian fare .    there ' s one part of the menu where you can basically choose from lots of different kinds of meat /  seafood /  tofu and a variety of sauces to get a plate ,  with rice ,  for a fixed price of around 12-13 dollars .   the meat is very tender and juicy ,  although i thought my duck dish could have used a little more duck - i presumed they went veggie- heavy to keep the price in line with the cheaper meat dishes .   dinner for two can be had for around 25-30 dollars plus tip ,  and you ' re likely to have some leftovers to take home .   although the inside of the restaurant is very nice ,  there are also several sidewalk tables for eating outdoors during nice weather .   the restaurant is located in a mostly residential neighborhood next to the parking lot for a dry cleaners ,  but the presence of truffles cafe a couple doors down makes this a pretty busy restaurant block on a nice night .    recently asian grille has started offering live music .   one night a week  ( i think fridays )  is acoustic night ,  and on sunday and possibly wednesday there are amplified bands playing jazz ,  blues etc .   although the music is good ,  amped music in such a small space tends to drown out conversation ,  so if you ' re planning to have a long intimate chat ,  pick a non-music night or else go early as the tunes don ' t start till after 7 pm .   or plan to eat outside .    one potential minus to be aware of:  the place does not serve beer ,  wine or liquor .   however ,  they do let you byo ,  at least your own bottle of wine ,  as i ' ve seen people doing that . 
__label__5 best thai food on the west side .  easily .  it ' s so good that as i type this my mouth is watering .  no really .    it ' s great for take out ,  and also a fun place to go eat with a group of friends .  bring your own bottle of wine and make it even more fun .    the shrimp pad thai is awesome .  it ' s sweet yes tangy .  my only complaint is that they leave the tails on the shrimp ,  but i can overlook that considering how good it is .    i love the vegetable tempura as well .  the peanut sauce is tasty and spiced just enough to keep it interesting .  they also have great spring rolls .  thai iced tea is delicious as well . 
__label__4 the food is pretty good .  i ' m a big fan of spice and they have consistently added the perfect amount of heat to every dish i ' ve tried .  the portions are a good size as well .    i can walk here from my home .  i have only gotten take-out and delivery and have never ate in the restaurant so i ' m not too sure about the atmosphere or ambiance .  i know it ' s a bit dark which is always nice ,  in my opinion .    yes ,  they deliver !  i almost felt bad because the delivery girl actually walked to my house once .  i could have easily walked my fat ass over to the restaurant to pick up my order .  she laughed really hard when i told her that .  i gave her a nice tip .  so obviously ,  the delivery service is excellent .  anyone that will walk your order to your home because you ' re a lazy blob .  .  .  come on ,  that ' s good ,  right ?   man ,  i felt bad .   this is a nice little neighborhood restaurant that deserves your business .  check it out . 
__label__3 i ' m not sure why the reviews of ohio city dry cleaners is so bad ,  but i really think they ' re pretty good .   i don ' t really go to dry cleaners often- as ,  well ,  i don ' t really buy many "dry clean only" clothes ,  but after being matron of honor at a wedding ,  and after having the best man hand me a drink that proceeded to spill onto my dress  ( on purpose ?  who knows )  ,  i needed my beautiful bridesmaid dress dry cleaned .    they ' re open until 6pm  ( not sure what that other yelp review was saying )  and i dropped off my dress no problem- with a charge of $12 .  it was ready in a few days- and i thought ,  in my opinion ,  the dress came out looking brand new and the stains were gone- and i had no issue with it .   i didn ' t think the dry cleaners smelled smoky ,  there was nothing wrong with my dress ,  and i feel like the people there were very friendly- i mean ,  if you treat people with respect ,  they ' ll treat you with respect as well .  was it a good price ?  i thought it was decent- but seeing i don ' t really get dry cleaning done very often ,  i ' m not a pro- i also don ' t need my dry cleaners to have a seamstress- so alterations aren ' t a need on my list  ( which this dry cleaners didn ' t have )  .   overall ,  i would go here again if i needed dry cleaning- it ' s a nice local place and it ' s rather convenient as well .  they do a good job . 
__label__5 so far ,  excellent .   i live downtown but had to quit going to bill ' s cleaners because they kept retuning my clothes dirty .   ohio city cleaners has made the trip across the bridge well worth it .   the people there are friendly ,  their prices are reasonable ,  and we get our clothes back clean .   highly recommend . 
__label__5 i found aria as a recommendation on yelp and honestly everything was fantastic .  i will admit ,  i ' ve only gotten my nails done professionally three times total  ( including this visit )  .  i got a gel full set with tips and gel polish ,  and honestly the whole experience was great .   i came in about 20 minutes early  ( for once ,  i overestimated traffic )  and got there around 5:40 for a 6pm appointment .  there was one other person there who was finishing her pedicure ,  but ty got started with me as soon as she was done .  i told him i didn ' t know exactly what a full set was but that i wanted one .  he explained the lengths of the tips ,  what went into the process ,  and even showed me the solar nail powder which was what i ended up choosing .  ty was really personable and honest about the whole process .  i also have the decision-making power of a rock ,  so even after we ' d decided on a color ,  i went back and chose something completely different and he was really patient with me .  i definitely want to go back to get my fills from him ,  and would highly recommend this salon to anyone . 
__label__5 excellent service !  was done exactly how i wanted it to be .  very good place to go to for nail service !  !  ! 
__label__5 cleveland clinic has one of the best cardiology departments in the world .  in the last 18 months i have had 3 family members pull through cardiac problems with the help of the clinic . 
__label__3 holy bad neighborhood batman !  !   i mean its a supermarket ,  that has supermarket-y things stocked on the shelves .  it also has a pretty decent produce selection for those wonderful veggie and fruit picnics on the lake . 
__label__3 this establishment is in one of my favorite areas of cleveland .   nearby to so many other fantastic restaurants ,  this place is decidedly average ,  and i ' m okay with that .   on a sunday morning i woke up with an asian food itch that i just had to scratch .   looking around online at all of the options available ,  i ran across the e . 30th street cafe and thought it ' s generic grab-bag of eastern dishes would suit .   the wife and i got on the shoreway for a quick trip from lakewood ,  and we arrived in the parking lot in under 20 minutes .   we ordered sushi .   yeah .  .  .  i know .  .  .   ordering sushi at such a place is frequently a recipe for disaster ,  but this was actually decent .   the knife cuts were a bit sloppy on the sashimi ,  but the rolls were well executed .   don ' t get me wrong ,  it ' s no shuhei ,  but it actually managed to beat out the garbage at sushi rock by a fair margin .   interestingly enough while we were eating ,  a pair of gentlemen came in with a bag of vegetables ,  and the bag was carried off to the kitchen .   i don ' t know what was in the bag exactly ,  but what came back out of the kitchen did smell rather good .   this place is one of those places that ' s trying to be everything to everyone ,  and ends up being pretty average .   the prices of some things are out of whack ,  but then other things are comparatively cheap .   give it a shot .   at the very least when you ' re done eating you can stop in to the park to shop to stock up your pantry . 
__label__4 i ' m pleasantly surprised by how great this place is !  i took my family here on a weekday night and there was literally no other customers in the restaurant .  uh oh .  this may be a bad sign ,  but we took a chance and sat down anyways .  the service was quick and friendly and we got our food within 5 minutes of ordering !  !  to start off ,  the restaurant gave us free chinese herbal soup ,  which was so delicious that it brought me back to my childhood in china .  we ordered two dim sum dishes ,  the black bean spare ribs and the chicken hands .  these are two of my favorite dim sum dishes and this place did a great job making them !  the only complaint i have is that each tiny dish was $4 .  too expensive for dim sum ,  man .  but still ,  if you ' re craving dim sum though ,  this place serves it day and night !  we also ordered the peking duck .  yum !  the duck skin was super crunchy and the sauce was a combination of sweet and savory .  we ended our meal with the spicy braised fish .  sadly ,  this dish was neither flavorful nor spicy .  we ended up just taking this dish to go and added our own spice and flavors to it at home .  you ' re better off getting this dish at wonton or szechuan gourmet .   aside from a few complaints ,  i liked this restaurant and will be coming back again ! 
__label__3 this newly minted chinese  ( asian is more like it )  restaurant is clean and  classy .  since it opened recently in december of 2010 ,  i ' ve been trying to get myself in there and try some of their offerings .  so here ' s what i did notice ,  the restaurant ,  part of the li wah family of restaurant .  which is just a earshot from east 30th .  most of us knows that li wah serves decent dim sum and many have written well of that business .  why they decide to open another eatery in the same plaza is beyond me .  east 30th ,  seem to encompass a little too much asian in a small menu .  appetizer section starts the confusion . the offering starts from spring roll to summer roll .  if you are of the discerning crowd when it comes to asian cuisine .  you notice that they are of really different genre of asian food .  they try to incorporate far eastern cuisine  ( chinese and japanese )  with shots of vietnamese and cambodian food in the mix .  on the menu ,  are items from shrimp dumpling noodle soup ,  sushi and sashimi to beef pho .  the dishes  ( from the "chief ' s specialty section )  i had was decent .  it was the fish filet and vegetables with rice .  it ' s taste good but it was not something i write home about ,  just yelp about ;- )   ultimately ,  east 30th ,  is trying to be the jack of all asian cuisine but really it ' s the master of none  ( yet )  .  so let ' s hope they hone in on something and make it so good you ' ll drive for miles just to get your fingers on it .  good luck ,  east 30th . 
__label__1 wish i could give negative stars .  yes ,  it was that bad .  hope we don ' t get food poisoning . 
__label__4 awesome deli / restaurant .  open late and they serve excellent fresh food and the staff is on point .  it ' s a nice place to relax after an evening out and the atmosphere is comfortable .   ( desserts are amazing )  : )  you won ' t be disappointed . 
__label__5 my boyfriend took me here and i fell in love .   breakfast 24 / 7 ,  the best grilled chicken gyro  ( yes ,  i am a vegetarian but i do occasionally eat chicken )  and the lemon chicken rice soup  ( sat and sun only )  is worth it even in 90 degree weather !   the mac and cheese is fantastic  ( mostly available during lent on fridays )  and the boyfriend loves the stuffed baked potato when it is on special .     nice desert selection and really nice staff .   greek favorites as well as a really good fruit plate make this a go to for us . 
__label__4 my friends is a frequent meal spot for me .  breakfast ,  lunch and dinner all delicious .  friendly service ,  never a wait .  ideal diner food with some yummy specials .  haven ' t been disappointed yet and probably won ' t ever be .  steak and eggs was one of my favorites for when i ' m ready for a protein overload .    go there and make sure to get dessert .  the tiramisu heavenly .  pies and cakes to your hearts desire .    i wouldn ' t go there if you are in a rush .  as others have said service can be a bit slow but its a wonderful aspect when you ' re looking to relax for an hour or two with food and beverages . 
__label__1 puke all over the bathroom .  hair in my burger .  waitress was rude .  most disgusting place in greater cleveland .  .  .  . 
__label__2 the food was generally good but there was hair in two of our dishes and some of the servers were abrupt and borderline rude .  however ,  our server anne was polite and quickly addressed our concerns about the hair in our food . 
__label__2 i have been here several times over the last three years .  every previous experience was so-so ,  and i only reluctantly gave it another chance after waiting more than six months .  my most recent visit  ( and it will be my last )  was for breakfast .    the host literally threw the menu on the table as he turned his back and walked away .  the waitress seemed annoyed by my very presence even though the place was nearly empty during a late nite / early morning shift .  she never even attempted a re-fill on my coffee  ( a must for any diner-type restaurant )  until i was entirely finished with my meal ,  even though another table 10 feet away sat down and ordered coffee after me .  she had the pot in her hand and never bothered to even ask me !  despite the absolutely atrocious service ,  i will say that the food was actually pretty good ,  although slightly over-priced: $11 for an omelette ,  toast and one solitary cup of coffee is a bit much .    i will not be back . 
__label__3 open 24 hours is great !  great dessert and i love chicken waldorf wrap . however the staff is weird and off standish . 
__label__3 i was in the mood to grab breakfast for dinner ,  but wanted to try a new place .  this is not a restaurant you go to for new flavor combinations or innovative meals .   this is where you go to get something familiar and leave with a full belly .     the service was ok ,  pretty much what you ' d expect .  i was a bit perturbed that our bread basket had an empty butter thing in it .   it ' s just those little things that make you wonder if you will return in the near future .   my scrambled eggs and french toast were exactly what i expected .  i did appreciate that the french toast was not burnt at all .   my husband ordered fried chicken and he ate it all so i guess it was good .     again ,  food and service were fine if you want standard american fare .  but i ' d probably return to another similar restaurant simply due to some service and atmospheric issues . 
__label__2 i have been twice and was not impressed with the food ,  but its 24 hours so its a plys when you want some  random food . 
__label__2 nothing special about it .  snapper had flat taste .  batter was good but it was coming off too easily leaving less taste in a bite .  chicken and pasta soup wasn ' t too speciak either .  overall i would say the food wasn ' t tasty . 
__label__4 nice place for breakfast .  its been a few since since i last visited .  this used to be my favorite post bar closing food stop .  might be the first time i have ever been here sober and in the daylight .  the wait staff was very friendly and helpful .  the food came to the table rather quickly and tasted great !  ! 
__label__5 so we went to my friends after a night of drinking downtown and let me tell you !  !  !  !   it was exactly what my body needed .   when we got there ,  right away i knew this was the spot that everyone went to after a night of clubbing / drinking .   it was crowded but still very spacious .   it did not take long for us to get a table for 7 people .   our waitress was very on top of their game !   she took our orders right away and was very helpful with explaining the menu and giving suggestions .   our food came out quick and was delicious .   i was completely starving when we got here so i ordered 2 appetizers- potato pancakes and the hummus plate .   and both was so good !  !  !  !  !   i am still dreaming about those potato pancakes .   for my meal portion i ordered the veggie burger with fries and a side of bbq !   i highly suggest this meal !   i ate everything that was on my plate !   as we were leaving and closing our check ,  i noticed all the yummy looking deserts in the display case and had to order a snickers pie slice to go !   it satisfied my sweet tooth that evening .   and also ,  i think my eyes were way bigger than my stomach that night !   so with me getting 2 appetizers ,  a meal ,  and desert it was less than $30 .   i totally appreciated that !   and for sure will be back ,  hopefully when i am a little more sober . 
__label__5 best locksmith ,  seriously !  we go locked out of the house .  he got there quickly had everything he needed to get us back inside .  thank goodness too because we did not have the right key from the contractor who built it .  he then helped us replace the locks . 
__label__2 the food that we got was mostly cold .  the coleslaw was sitting on the counter on ice uncovered .  the  employee in the back making the food was texting on his phone the whole time in plain view .  was very disappointed . 
__label__4 i worked at a zeppes when i was younger and ever since then it ' s been my favorite pizza .  i ' ll gladly pay a little more for it because it always turns out good . 
__label__5 hole in the wall  ( good thing )  with food as good as new orleans .   cannot go wrong .  .  . go visit junior . 
__label__5 if you are in the cleveland area ,  this place is a must go .  from the appearance on the outside you wouldn ' t expect much but a normal restaurant in cleveland but on the inside ,  it is as if you are in a completely different universe .  easy laid back environment makes you feel as if you are at home .  junior  ( the chef )  is a man of many hats ,  and is the cook ,  dj ,  server ,  and owner .  even though he ' s the only man back in the kitchen and it make a little bit of time to get your food ,  the wait is worth it .  the food is made perfectly ,  everything that is fried has the right amount of crunch but isn ' t too greasy ,  the dishes give you a clear sense of what new orleans food is like ,  and it ' s because her takes the time to do so . 
__label__5 i lived in new orleans for four years before moving to cleveland .  .  . i have eaten in a couple of the cajun / creole restaurants in the city and nothing comes close to batiste and dupree i feel like i ' m home in new orleans everytime i eat here .  .  . best cajun food in cleveland !  !  ! 
__label__5 this is "nawlins" in ohio !  yes ,  i ' ve been to new orleans ,  as well as many other cajun / creole restaurants on extensive business travel ,  and junior battiste ' s restaurant is right at the top with the best of the best .  while traveling in the area ,  the restaurant came up on my gps search .   junior has a good selection of beers including new orleans own dixie and abita .  i started off with an abita christmas ale .  i selected the chicken remoulade entree - chicken croquets topped with remoulade sauce ,  served on maux choux  ( spicy cajun )  corn with jambalaya .  this was a great blend of flavors that complemented each other perfectly .  finished up with a piece of jamaican rum cake ,  delicious !  i will be going back to try more of their creations .   the restaurant is basically a small strip mall "corner bar & grille" ,  seating maybe 8 or 9 tables ,  and a number of bar stools .  junior maintains a very casual but extremely friendly atmosphere with personal attention .  it was very clear to me that he cares deeply about his restaurant ,  food and customers .  if you like cajun and creole ,  you must eat here ! 
__label__5 hearing many good things about the chef here so i had to try them out .  i ' m not aware of any cajun restaurants in the area so i was excited to get a chance to taste .  i got in on a group takeout order with friends from work and it was highly suggested that i try their wings .   i ordered the fun box which includes a po '  boy ,  wings and fries .  the po '  boy was legit with a soft roll ,  spicy sausage ,  crunchy coleslaw and fries on top .   yep ,  i would eat one of these again .   the fries are are something fun .   they are more of a steak fry with a spice seasoning sprinkled on them .   the real star were the wings .   crispy on the outside ,  maybe lightly floured ,  with a light slathering of  subtle sweet and spice sauce .   nothing overwhelming but as i started to eat a couple of these ,  the spice builds up .   really one of the best wings i ' ve had in the area .   from what i have sampled from their menu ,  i am very impressed with the quality and taste of the food . 
__label__4 good quality chicken .   nice apple chicken sausage . 
__label__1 without a doubt the worst chinese restaurant in cleveland  .  the restaurant is located in an old mcdonald ' s building barely fitted for a sit down restaurant .     i ordered an egg roll - it was average - mustard and ketchup containers used for hot mustard and sweet and sour - cute .    i ordered walnut chicken - a "new" menu item - it was horrible .  i was expecting something fast fried in a brown sauce and stir fried with honey walnuts .  what i received was a pile of "white" fried chicken with a flavorless sauce and some walnuts thrown in .  it tasted like cornstarch -the sauce had absolutely no flavor - i would have added soy sauce ,  but i don ' t need the extra sodium and there might not have been enough in the restaurant to spice it up .      the service was extremely friendly and very attentive - so much so that i couldn ' t bring myself to complain about the food .   i simply asked for a carryout container ,  boxed it up ,  and threw it out at my hotel .     it was really cheap though - $15 . 00 for entree and egg roll .   i was on my expense account ,  so it didn ' t bother me to go somewhere else to eat that night .     but do yourself a favor - this place is not good .   ignore the internet reviews .   i can ' t believe that anything here has any flavor .  .  .  . 
__label__5 this is by far my favorite penn station location .  some of the employees have been there for a long time .  super clean and friendly .    they always have the daily newspaper on the counter ,  so you and flip through it while you wait .    it is a little pricey ,  but i really do love their artichoke sandwich .  i wish there were more coupons .  occasionally i get one for free fries ,  but i would probably go more often if i got sub coupons . 
__label__2 let me just say ,  i want to love this place ,  i really do !  but .  .  . it ' s really quite underwhelming .  have dined here twice ,  once for lunch / once for breakfast .  the lunch was great .  breakfast just stunk .  my over medium eggs had runny whites and the sausage side was burned .  painful trying to flag down the waitress who seemed interested in chatting up the regulars than assisting us .  it ' s cheap ,  but it ' s not worth it .  better off going down the road to eat at joe ' s: better quality control and waitresses .  shame i don ' t like this place ,  it ' s so close to my house . 
__label__5 great food  !  !  !  !  great value for the price awesome staff quick and easy breakfast ,  lunch or before the game .  .  . 
__label__5 this hole-in-the-wall deli has become one of my default eating spots while studying down the street at le csu .  good food ,  great prices ,  typically friendly folks  ( unless they ' re busy ,  then don ' t try talking to anyone more than is necessary to order )  .    only complaint is that whenever i eat in ,  i leave smelling like butter somehow . 
__label__2 bottom line: i would not return .    i don ' t know what i did to offend the two people working the counter at huron square deli this morning .  granted ,  i walked all the way inside the restaurant to make a to-go order ,  when apparently there is a window to the right of the door to the restaurant where one makes to-go orders and waits for them .  my bad ,  i didn ' t see it ,  and i had never been to this restaurant before so didn ' t know any better .  they were incredibly rude about dismissing me and acting like i was causing them a huge inconvenience by trying to order breakfast at the counter .  i was the only customer ordering at that moment ,  and i believe there were one or two other patrons in the otherwise empty restaurant ,  so it ' s not like i was crowding other ,  seated customers .    anyway ,  they finally deigned to take my order .  to their credit ,  it was only $4 . 77 for a breakfast sandwich  ( egg ,  cheese ,  and bacon )  and a 20 oz iced coffee .  the food was only adequate--the bacon was chewy ,  and the bread was standard white bread .  but fine .  the coffee seemed like it might have been hot coffee poured over ice--it was very watery .    there is a serious dearth of grab and go breakfast options in this area of cleveland--but i ' d look hard for a different one rather than go to huron . 
__label__5 severance hall has always been one of those mystic unicorns that you hear is super amazing but somehow never seen- making it even more alluring .  i ' ve read that "all seats are good seats" but some of the pictures and the seating chart made me question that- i was wrong .  even up in the middle of the balcony is was cozy and intimate and our seats were still great .    the interior is such a combination of styles which makes it an interesting form of beautiful .  they also decorated for the holidays extremely well which made me happy .  i know nothing about acoustics but more acoustically gifted people say the way the sound travels in this building is phenomenal .  when you go to a show most people go to see and hear something beautiful .  so that ' s a check and a check .    i took my mother to see the orchestra and bought the prepaid parking .  it was perfect because it ' s connected to severance which means you don ' t have to waddle like a penguin outside across snow and ice in insensible shoes .  they also had staff directing the traffic out afterwards which helped alleviate the mass chaos we started out in .   some people have qualms that the seats and rows are too small but this building was completed in 1931 .  that was 85 years ago !  !  !  !  humans have gotten larger  ( in every direction )  in the 90 years from when they made the blueprints .  expecting big seats is like wondering why your 1967 mustang doesn ' t do as well as your wrangler in the snow .  appreciate the discomfort and marvel at your show ! 
__label__4 it ' s hard to make a really good yearo  ( to spell it the way it is pronounced )  ,  because all but one of the ingredients come prepackaged .  that lump of spiced beef and lamb comes from a commercial distributor .  so ,  probably ,  did the pita bread .   this is why ,  if you ' re at a street fair ,  gyros are safe choices .  unless the meat was pre-cut and then left unrefrigerated to go bad )  ,  everyone pretty much uses the same stuff .   the only things you can do to make the food good are  ( 1 )  select very high-quality lettuce ,  white onion and tomatoes at the wholesale market on e 55th and  ( 2 )  make a good tzatziki  ( the cucumber ,  yogurt and garlic sauce )  .   gyro guys does both .  one of the things that helps is that the owner runs a catering business after he closes at 7 pm .  that ' s a cut-throat industry; pink ,  tasteless tomatoes  ( with unripened centers )  and wilted lettuce will cost you a client .  by getting the stuff for one business ,  they can use it in the day job .   it ' s why the potatoes and rings taste better-- he ' s using better product .  the beer in the ring batter helps too ,  and they change the oil regularly .  rings  ( which are harder to get right )  are better than the fries  ( i know 5-10 places as good )  .   the sauce has good product-- and it isn ' t jazzed up .  they ' re not under the delusion that it should taste like big mac sauce  ( as the overhyped place a few blocks north believes )  .  it ' s supposed to be a little sharp ,  so it bites you a bit and highlights the meat .  the yogurt isn ' t bland white stuff; you can taste the cucumber and the garlic    ( the other review is right; it does use a lot .  as martha stewart ,  the daughter of satan likes to say ,  this is "a good thing" .  )   size on the colossus is good .  i ' m a big guy and it fills me up .  prices are reasonable ,  given the amount of food .    can ' t say how the service is because i ' ve never come in when they were slammed .  every time it ' s been really fast .  but if there ' s one person in front of you and no one behind you  , how can you judge ?   never ordered any sandwich but the gyros ,  but i assume the other stuff is fine .  the guy runs a catering business; i figure he knows how to make a turkey or tuna salad sandwich .   ,    docking one star because  ( 1 )  traffic can be a hassle and street parking can be a little tough  ( best bet is the side street ,  but you can end up being pretty far down the block ,   ( 2 )  no fountain drinks  ( only cans and bottles )  ,  which means no ice on hot days and  ( 3 )  all they got is baklava for dessert .   but if you need a gyro ,  this would definitely be the pace to go . 
__label__5 charmed ,  i ' m sure you ' ll be .  fluffy duck is almost as adorable as its name ,  and located on the ground floor of the innova residential building .  walking inside was a little like stepping into a meditation room filled with pastries .  peaceful ,  clean ,  white walls and counters ,  wooden furniture ,  and of course ,  the smell of fresh bread .  as i perused the menu and baked goods  ( kouign amanns !  !  )  ,  i could see the open kitchen space just beyond ,  where staff were busy rolling out dough and prepping other sorts of tempting things .   the tea is served in afternoon tea worthy china - it practically begs to be photographed .  the teapot for some reason though kept sticking to the countertop when i tried to pick it up .  i ' m not sure if this was a poor-design thing ,  sticky surfaces ,  or just an artifact of tea drip .  some of the food items were a little on the pricier side ,  but my turkey sandwich did have avocado and was layered with absolutely delicious bread .  the ham sub sandwich and pizza options were more economical and i ' m sure scrumptious as well .    as previously mentioned ,  free wi-fi is available .  you ' ll find some charging outlets near the window seats ,  but if you ' re just there to enjoy a nice lunch or conversation ,  the tables will do very nicely .  two any-gender bathrooms along the far side .  it was very quiet when i went ,  with only a few people coming in and out during the lunch hour ,  which made it a great place to study .  i ' m conflicted since i ' d rather not have to compete for prime laptop space as it becomes busier .  but ,  i do hope fluffy duck starts getting the attention it deserves to keep swimming along ! 
__label__4 gorgeous little cafe .   i found the bright interior of fluffy duck to be very soothing and the smells coming from the bakery were mouth watering .   i recently stopped in on my way to the cleveland clinic across the street ,  fyi there is additional parking in the back of the building .  their cafe latte was fantastic ,  they use local whole milk and you can really taste the difference in the quality of beans .   you couldn ' t go wrong with any of the huge selection of fresh pastries but i specifically recommend the croissant ,  lemon blueberry scone and if they have them the kouign amann which was fantastic !  make sure to stop in to grab a cup and don ' t forget something sweet to pair it with ,  you won ' t regret it ! 
__label__3 i ' m not a fan of jimmy johns ,  their limited sub choices ,  lack of sides ,  only one choice for cheese and no toasted or hot subs sucks .   but i must admit that the meat ,  cheese and bread is top quality .  the roast beef with provolone is starting to grow on me .   i still don ' t understand all the hype ,  it ' s just ok .  and the music is always too loud .  but it ' s starting to grow on me . 
__label__4 jimmy john ' s is always delicious .  these workers are some of the fastest i ' ve  encountered and we ' re nice enough to make orders for 6 people even though they were closing in 3 minutes and were about to lock up when we arrived .  they didn ' t have to serve us but they did and the sandwiches were very well made ! 
__label__5 this neighborhood bakery & cafe is the original location of 3 throughout cleveland .  it is bright ,  airy and cheerful with terrific sandwiches ,  an excellent selection of croissant ,  breads ,  cookies and fancy cakes & cheesecakes .  their signature breads run out fast so go early if you want baguette or challah .    in the mornings there is a steady stream of business people and meetings .  lunch is hectic on the weekends but always satisfying .  dinner time finds folks getting a bite before seeing a movie at the cedar lee .    all in all a lovely place to eat ,  drink coffee ,  chat and people watch out the large windows that face the street or on the back patio .    i am writing this review to give perspective in case anyone should read jo t ' s angry and bizarre treatise .  i am hoping she finds a way to spend time writing the novel she obviously has in her so she can stop saying unnecessarily mean things about service workers . 
__label__5 i miss many things from my time living in cleveland ,  and this is probably at the top of the list .   i lived just doors away from this charming bakery ,  and ate at least one meal a day here .   the staff was always so pleasant ,  the food always perfect ,  and the coffee always strong and fresh  as far as pastries go ,  you couldnt go wrong with any of them ,  honestly ,  ive had everything over the course of my three years living near-by and i was never unhappy .   however ,  if one thing stands out ,  its the poppy seed tea biscuit .   this heavenly pastry was always in demand ,  and i can remember two instances where fights broke out over the last one ,  and i am not joking .   it became a weekend tradition for me to go early on a saturday and get two ,  knowing that i wouldnt make it in time to get one on sunday morning ,  and to be without it ,  well ,  you dont want to make me sad ,  do you ?     they offer a few soups everyday ,  and always a vegetarian option ,  and again ,  ive had just about every one they make ,  and was always pleased .   also ,  their sandwiches ,  served with tasty couscous  ( how healthy !  )  were a major part of my diet--my only complaint is that they never had regular yellow mustard ,  just honey mustard ,  so i would generally have to get my sammys to go and put mustard on them at home .  .  . oh well !   beyond the service ,  and food ,  the general neighborhood feel of bakery / cafe was delightful .   i recently watched a docu about "the big-boxing" of america ,  and how smaller ,  mom-and-pop shops are being leveled to make way for the big corporations ,  and i immediately thought of this place ,  and the cedar-lee neighborhood i lived in ,  only to get 2 / 3 of the way through the film and see them tape a portion inside  from a booth ive sat at many times ,  it was surreal ,  and very apropos; this is one mom-and-pop that wont ever close ,  and for good reason ! 
__label__4 what a pleasant experience !  i immediately ventured to this place after the disappointment of on the rise artisan  ( which i have reviewed !  )  .  ordering and wait time was excellent .  i ended up with the turkey orzo soup ,  roasted veggie sandwich on multigrain bread ,  and couscous .  it sounds like a regular sized meal ,  but i was stuffed .  i ate it all while i studied for two hours .    soup was delicious and piping hot ,  just the way i like it !  bread was a great balance of crusty outside and soft inside .  the sandwich was a good mix of favors ,  but i ' ll probably try something else next time .  this was my first taste of couscous ,  and it wasn ' t bad !  dill isn ' t my favorite flavor ,  but it was tolerable in this side dish .    in the end ,  it was a good meal to help me get through my studying . 
__label__4 great place to sit down and have a good cup of coffee .  came here on a friday evening for coffee and dessert and i was very impressed !  leina ordered the lemon bar and i had the strawberry cream cheese croissant .  both desserts were excellent !  we also shared a latte ,  which was pretty darn good as well .  i am looking forward to my next visit to stone oven ! 
__label__4 actually pretty surprised to find this place packed on a monday at 2pm .  .  .  . it is cleveland after all so i ' ve become used to everything looking abandoned .  very friendly and didn ' t even bat an eye when i supplied them with with my favorite fake name "gomez" .  oh yea my sandwich was good too . 
__label__3 very underwhelmed .   we had a pb&j  ( over $4 . 00 for some smuckers for a little kid ?  !  )  with couscous and a cold chicken salad sandwich on wheat .   the pb&j was your regular pb and j .   the chicken salad was sad .   it had no real flavor and was dressed with a piece of tired old lettuce .   panera is waaaay better tasting .   the bread was soft and was the only thing decent besides the tabbouleh ,  which was excellent .  couscous was bland .  the restaurant ambiance was fine ,  but the floor needed attention ,  tons of garbage and crumbs all over .   the napkins are impossible to find .    the employees looked bored ,  no one was particularly friendly .   bought a cookie for the kid ,  she liked it .   husband bought a brownie .  .  . it was dry . 
__label__5 i came in last week and ordered a ham and cheese croissant and a loaf of sour dough bread to go .   i was so excited that i stopped in !   the service was friendly and i can ' t wait to come back and order sandwiches or other kinds of croissants .     the sour dough bread i took home tasted like sour dough from san fran ! 
__label__1 william golding ,  lord of the flies ,  stranded kids went to beach ,  where they didn ' t find a conch ,  instead they found a doll house .  they brought it back into the jungle and played coffee shop ,  and are playing ever since .  that ' s what it feels like ,  or sounds like .   the presence of an adult ,  meaning not age ,  but maturity ,  is very much missing ,  and seems the only thing that possibly could balance the lack of education ,  i am not talking about reading lists and math problems  ( some kids in here are students and may or may not have wealthy parents )  ,  but instead the understanding of how one might want to behave as staff working within the hospitality business in order to create a comfortable atmosphere and leave a good impression .  which is the point of it .  some of us want customers to come back .  of course in a town where is nothing to do and nowhere to go people will always come ,  because there is drastic lack of options and concurrence .  that does not make it any better .  on the contrary .   ( recently i heard someone on the radio say ,  he is an "enthusiast of the cleveland renaissance" ,  i nearly died from laughing .  dream on .  but excellent promo !  )   apropos flies ,  pointed out a fly sitting on a pastry to staff ,  asked counter girl to get rid of it .  she looked at me with a "why do you bother me with that ? "-look ,   ( i bother you with that ,  girlie ,  because i had originally intended to eat the pastry and now i am simply not so sure anymore )  ,  she asking out loudly: "alright .  where is it ? "  funny enough ,  the man next to me had also spent his waiting-in-line-time watching a fly on the pastry ,  so he pointed straight at it "there ! " ,  and it turns out: it was a different fly ,  whilst i pointed at my personal favourite fly for the morning "there ! " so when you stand in line you can pass time watching flies on pastries ,  maybe you can even place bets on them with people waiting next to you ,  but think twice if you feel like angering the kids behind the counter bringing flies on the pastry or anything else you might be concerned about to their attention .   what you must know is: these children think a saucer is a thing that flies over the skies of arizona ,  they have never seen a tea-spoon in their lives  ( and never will )  ,  they do not know exactly how to make coffee ,  and the mere fact that they are apparently being paid to stand around in a coffee shop does not in any way increase the desire to learn about any of these things  ( "what for ?  i am studying to be a dancer ! " )  ,  because  ( and this is where you didn ' t know the facts ) : they own the universe .  or they own cleveland ,  or they own this shop ,  or all together or none of it .  or they live in that kind of mental reality that they seem to think they do ,  which seems to be good enough .  see above: the "grown-up" to set them straight ,  or fires them ,  if everything else fails to be effective ,  is simply non-existent ,  god knows .   that means: you are an absolute intruder in this dream world .  you really should be glad they even as much as look at you ,  mostly they will not anyways ,  you do not deserve it .   if they serve you ,  that is because they are in a generous mood today ,  but don ' t draw the wrong conclusions ,  you are only a temporary guest in here and you don ' t count ,  who really counts is them ,  oh ,  and do make sure you tip generously ,  and say "thank you ! " with a bow .   i am not sure for what ,  but do it anyways ,  it is your best bet ,  i can tell you that much ,  next to ,  of course ,  not going there .   but if you have never been there you would never be able to imagine it ,  so i recommend for that reason alone ,  go and have a look ,  at least once .   or make a recording in the garden ,  where you can hear them through the open kitchen door ripping their guests ,  bosses and each other off in a jaw-dropping way .  not exactly "quality-driven" .  all this is ,  in a bizarre way ,  quite funny . 
__label__1 unbelivably rude service staff .  handed me a pair of glasses and then insinuated "it looks like you just came out of a wal-mart vision center"  ( you picked them out !  you handed them to me !  whats wrong with wal mart ?  )  then suggested only my significant other could be trusted to pick out my frames .  excuse me ?  whose making  the purchase here ?  home of the rudest employee in the heights .  go elsewhere . 
__label__4 the staff here are friendly ,  very knowledgeable and patient when they provided me with options on which eyeglass frame best suited me .   i had some issues with the nosepads ,  i brought them back in for an adjustment and it was done in a timely fashion .   i would highly recommend park opticians for your next pair of frames .   if you want some high quality frames outside of the cheap stuff they have at lenscrafters ,  definitely make a visit here to see the variety of awesome frames they have .   they carry ic berlin ,  tag ,  and a lot of foreign frames that are awesome !   2 thumbs up ! 
__label__4 one of the better local chain restaurants ,  and better than panini ' s ,  imo .   good food selection - have never been disappointed .   good beers on tap ,  and the world tour is a must for beer snobs .   friendly service and family-friendly ,  as well .   i ' ve eaten at the downtown ,  miles road and coventry locations ,  and they ' re all consistently good . 
__label__4 the reviews on the wings are spot on .  try the thai / chili and goldfinger sauces .  .  . damn fine ! 
__label__5 the only thing i ' ve ever had here is the wings but those are good enough that i don ' t mind leaving my thoughts .     soooo ,  tuesdays are 50-cent wing nights .   that ' s an amazing deal !   you can get the wings in sets of 5 and get a different flavor for each set .   once i try the wednesday ribs i ' ll update my review .   i ' m pretty excited about that .     anyway ,  the atmosphere is pretty cool; they have many tvs so if you want to watch a game or something it ' s perfect for a group .   update: ok ,  so the ribs aren ' t that great .   they are pretty good and for the price i ' d probably get them again but if you ' re picky about your ribs these might upset you .   they are a little dry and their sauce isn ' t anything special but i am easy to please when it comes to food usually so i loved them . 
__label__4 i needed a place to go grab a bite after a visit to cleveland clinic .  my shuttle driver suggested winking lizard .  i thanked him profusely when he returned to pick us up .  no drinkers in my crowd but the beer selection was phenomenal .   started with mac n cheese wedges and ended with some great sandwiches .   something for everyone 8 to 80 .  service was just as great !  ! 
__label__4 the lizard ' s management appears consistently to value the benefits is keeping their draft beer lines pristinely clean - that and their attitude towards reasonably priced draft beer specials will keep any aficionado supremely happy .  if you ' re a beer fan in general the more than 100 bottle list will keep you fluid .   food wise ,  the burgers are the best around at the price; wings are not up to anchor bar in buffalo standard by any imaginative stretch ,  but locally ,  again ,  are hard to beat .   as a plus ,  the service staff is the most professional in this class of restaurant you ' re likely to find anywhere and aside from the to be expected occasional malcontents a great group of actual professionals .  enjoy !  by the way ,  the current manager ,  kevin ,  obviously beloved by his staff ,  is either moving on to better and better venues or the top management of the l understands his professionalism and is clearly promoting him !  !  ! 
__label__5 i went there for the first time the other day because i always seemed to go there at the times they won ' t allow the crowd younger than 21 in .  after i became of age ,  i went in the middle of the day  ( sadly before their deal for cheap wings )  and the bartender was also waiting all the tables in that room as well .  she remained extremely friendly the entire time and our food came quickly and well done .  now that i think of it ,  when i was underage they even turned me down in the nicest way possible ,  even after i pleaded with them that i only wanted wings !   i ' m huge on customer service ,  so this place gets 5 / 5 stars . 
__label__2 this place used to awesome until it turned from a cool bar to a "family" place .   even their menu shifted .   it ' s all about churning the bucks here-no sweet ,  fun bar anymore .   now it ' s like tgifriday ' s .   nothing like seeing tables full of misbehaving kids in a bar that ' s blasting nsfw muzak while bar patrons yell obscenities at their favorite sports games .    suggestions:  no kids  ( that ' s under 18 )  ,  period ,  after 5pm .   with mommy and daddy or not .    i go to a bar to get away from kids ,  not to chill with them .  and lizard ,  get the retro menu back . 
__label__2 perhaps familiarity truly breeds contempt .   if so ,  i have spent waaaaaaaaaay too much time at the lizard .   maybe contempt is the wrong word .   i don ' t hate it ,  but if i never set foot in here again ,  i will not for a second regret it .   the good: multiple rooms ,  multiple bars ,  loads of tables and ,  saving the best for last ,  the beer of the month club .   for an extra $0 . 75 to $1 . 00 ,  you get to keep the glass - which helped me to accumulate quite the collection for my own bar ,  which may someday exist .   the bad  ( neutral ) : just your average bar food - nothing bad ,  nothing good ,  nothing special .   it really is just meh .   depending on what you are looking for ,  the 400 televisions could be a plus or minus ,  but i ' ll throw it here in the middle .   the service is usually ok as well .   the ugly: i have to say ,  it ' s the crowd .   sorry .   this place is generally packed and loud .   i ' ve always gotten the impression it ' s crowded more because it ' s one of the only places to go as opposed to being crowded because it ' s a great place that no one can resist .   oh ,  yeah .   the trapped iguana is not cool .   i ' m sure they take good care of it ,  but i ' m sure it would have a better life without the drunken masses tapping on the glass .   look ,  if you want to go get a beer ,  a bite of fried whatever ,  and catch a game ,  the lizard is a fine place to go .   i go back to plenty of 2-star places .   i ' d just prefer to go elsewhere .   the main problem i always had with coventry ,  there just aren ' t that many "elsewheres" to go . 
__label__1 if i could give them a negative ,  i would .  i will look for as many platforms to post this review as possible .    i had an issue with my boarding position on my flight cross country .  as a result ,  the southwest rep said she would refund the amount i paid for my early bird boarding position for my return flight ,  but ,  assured me my early bird boarding would still be valid .  i checked in online and found she had actually deleted my early bird purchase and as a result ,  i got a horrible boarding position .   ( which means middle seat while flying all day )  i called the airline and after an hour on the phone was told they could only help me if i had purchased the "anytime" ticket  ( which cost a few hundred dollars more )  instead of the "wanna get away" .  so basically ,  they only care if you spend more money .  this is unacceptable .  i flew internationally about a year ago with a different airline ,  and after running into a seating issue ,  they found a creative way to fix the problem and satisfy the customer .  southwest may pride themselves on bargain prices ,  but the cost shouldn ' t be bargain service if you ever run into a problem .  and when anyone is flying ,  spending $500 plus ,  you should be able to count the company to care about its customers . 
__label__4 what an adorable little place .   the owners are kind and the welcoming atmosphere makes this a great spot to enjoy a hot beverage and anything from quiche to udon on their diverse menu .   i enjoyed the champon ramen with pork broth ,  vegetables and shrimp .   it ' s not like the ramen you would find in chicago or new york but it was flavorful and perfect for a cold wintery cleveland night .   i ' m looking forward to taking my kindle with me and enjoying a latte and pastry sometime soon . 
__label__4 while their service may be a tad bit slow at times ,  they prepare their food with the utmost care and attention .  the menu offers a variety of options ranging from quiches to udon to my personal favorite ,  teriyaki with sesame seeds .  the teriyaki with sesame seeds came out at the perfect temperature along with a side salad with ginger dressing .  i have to admit i was never a fan of ginger dressing but flying crane ' s has turned me into one .  i ' m thrilled they sell their homemade teriyaki sauce and ginger salad dressing as they ' ve become my go-to purchases after a great meal .   did i mention the variety of beverages they offer ?  !  i vote for the latte  ( hot or cold )  and the mango iced tea which is typically only offered in the summer .  their outdoor patio by the way is incredibly charming in the larchmere neighborhood . 
__label__4 cute family owned store !  the set up is definitely a huge appeal here .  .  . and you know your food is home cooked !    very eclectic menu which i ' m intrigued to try .  .  . it ranges from udon to curry chicken  to shepherd ' s pie to smoothies to  mac and cheese .  i tried the ramen which was pretty good ,  especially on a cold snowy day .  the meat itself  ( i got pork belly )  wasn ' t that great .  but the rest of it was tasty .   i ' ll def be back ,  but will probably try something else besides ramen on the varied menu .   they are byob which could be fun for brunch ! 
__label__2 very mixed experience .  there were 3 tables present ,  which seemed to completely overload their service .   ( my entree came 15 minutes after my partners )  .  the appetizer  ( gyoza )  was delicious ,  but they forgot the to bring the dipping sauce until we had eaten all but one of the gyoza .  my entree  ( mac and cheese )  was so overcooked that the pasta had melted into gloop ,  and was nearly unedible .  my partner ' s katsu-don was good but slightly overcooked .   really had high hopes after the gyoza ,  but the rest of the meal was either mediocre or outright terrible  ( and the price point was frankly a bit high ,  even if the food had been executed well )  .  combining the food with the poor service  ( which i could understand if they were slammed ,  but they weren ' t even half full )  ,  we won ' t be back . 
__label__4 our favorite brunch spot; the quiches are amazing ,  accompanied by fresh green salad w /  homemade dressing and fresh fruit .  the garden is a perfect outdoor dining spot that will make you long for summer .   take home some house made teriyaki sauce !  ! 
__label__5 the food was awesome .   i had quiche that came with fruit and a salad ,   it was so good .   my husband had the egg salad sandwich ,   he also loved the meal and commented on how great the texture of the salad was .   we did not get to dessert but everything looked so good .   a much added bonus was the outdoor cafe area ,  so big ,  so nice ,  and a great mix of sun and shade .  .  .  i wanted to take a nap there !   we will go back when we are in town . 
__label__5 there are few times in life when foot golf is provided at such a high level of satisfaction .   this was one of those times - mastick woods .   the holes are expertly crafted with plenty of casual water traps to keep the whole family entertained .   there are food stops along the way and a nice sushi restaurant in the woods to accommodate those searching for their soccer balls .   it ' s a place that cannot be found by anyone except those who already know where it is .   i would recommend this foot golf course to persons of age and willing . 
__label__4 i am a fan and i will return ,  however our server needed to learn her beer list .    i loved the atmosphere in this establishment ,  super edgy and different .  i loved the prices and i loved their hours .  the fact that they serve tacos for lunch everyday just captures my heart ,  unlike barrio downtown .    we ordered tacos to go and they were all delicious .  i tried the taco dorado which is their "house" taco ,  super delicious but be aware of the fact that the shell is deep fried .  i was told that the taco was just a hard shell not that it was deep fried .  i also ordered the carnitas taco which was delicious .  our group ordered queso and salsa which were both so good !    i will definitely return ,  i just wish the server would have been more prepared . 
__label__5 what a great place .  prices are good and food is amazing .  the mexican pizza and burrito bowl are my favorite .  they are on the cleseats app so i saved 15% off the entire bill including all our margaritas !  !  !  !  and we had a few ! 
__label__1 i ate her a year ago and the food was awful .  overpriced and i just don ' t know how you can mess up mexican food .  i haven ' t eaten there since and the reason i am leaving this review is because i had a marketing sticker from them placed on my windshield which of course did not come off clean and now i have to deal with removing the remnants of this sticker from this sub par mexican restaurant .  when i called to ask about it they claimed they don ' t ever place marketing stickers on cars and it was not them .  which makes no sense ,  why would someone just do that on their own ?  they could ' ve handled it better .  i know it doesn ' t seem like a big deal but the little things matter in this industry and the way they claimed no responsibility when i called to complain made it worse .  how is this place still open ? 
__label__2 this place has dropped off a bit in just the one year i was in cleveland .  .  . it used to be much bigger ,  but somehow collapsed upon itself .  the downstairs is still there ,  but don ' t be surprised if you don ' t notice it .  .  . its not marked in any way shape or form ,  and anyone working there will not really notice you ,  much less point it out .    if you need a new piece of glass ,  well ,  they have some .  .  . but nothing too exciting .  works in a pinch i guess .  the vinyl selection is a step above nothing .  .  . would be better if the selection  ( especially downstairs )  weren ' t so ratty ,  but if you really dig you ' ll find something worth taking home .   if you are already in the area ,  go ahead and stop by .  i would not suggest making a special trip just to come here ,  though .  .  . you will be let down . 
__label__4 tough review .   based upon what record stores were in the 80 ' s this place is sad .   but we are no longer living in the 80 ' s .   stores like this used to dot the landscape ,  but sadly only the strong have survived as shells of their former selves .    if you want to experience a store where you can physically explore vinyl for sale rather than perusing a web site ,  this is the place to go .   there are also collections of posters ,  shirts and other concert merch .   lots of incense and hookah supplies and a frequent smoker plan to boot .   if you feel a bit nostalgic for vinyl ,  worth a trip . 
__label__5 this place is awesome .  we have been taking our cars there for a few years now .  tim is always quick and professional .  the prices are always reasonable as well .  i know that my vehicles are in good hands when i drop them off here . 
__label__5 how it ' s taken me this long to discover warehouse beverage ,  i ' ll never know .  especially since i live less than 3 miles away !  i guess ,  i ' ve always thought this place was strictly for the home-brewer .  boy was i wrong !   yesterday ,  in an attempt to seek out some obscure craft brews for nye y2k10 ,  i consulted this trusty site to point me in the right direction for that very special brew .  thanks murray !   the place is basically divided in half with one side dedicated to wine and the other beer .  there ' s also bottling and brewing equipment if you ' re into that .    the selection here is outrageous .  more than i ' ve ever seen under one roof actually .  if you ' re a fan of craft & micro-brews ,  my guess is that you ' ll be quite pleased with the selection .  the two owners are very friendly ,  helpful and accommodating .  if there ' s a type of beer that you don ' t find here ,  let them know and they can order it for you .   i spent close to an hour just browsing all the various selections .  i settled on a german import wheat doppelbock titled: aventinus weizenbock by schneider & sohn .  i also picked up a seasonal dogfish head called chicory stout .    much love for warehouse bev .  i most certainly will be returning on a regular basis .   cheers ! 
__label__5 this place .  the beer and wine selection here is great and the staff is the most helpful !  i feel like anyone can find something to drink here and if you ' re looking for something specific--brewer or type of brew--the staff is there to help !  they ' ll gladly steer you in the correct direction and pack things up for you .    i bought  my husband some home brew supplies to get him started and i had no trouble figuring it out here .  i still know next to nothing about the hobby ,  so i can ' t say for sure if we ' ll be back here for brewing supplies ,  but we ' ll most certainly be back plenty for drinks . 
__label__3 people say this is the best beer store in town .  .  .  if so then that is kinda sad .   not a bad place at all but smaller than i ' d like .   needs more singles .  friendly /  knowledgeable owner . 
__label__5 undeniably the best beer selection in the cleveland area- even for a beer noob like me .   it ' s small ,  but do not let that distract from the large selection of rare brews .   user murray r .  compares the warehouse to a candy store ,  which reminds me of when the owner laughed at my impatience as my boyfriend looked at each one of the many choices of stouts they offer .   "honey ,  it ' s like when you go to your shoe store- you just got to let him do his thing . "  i had to smile because he was dead on .   although several places offer christmas ale ,  i will only support this small cleveland business when purchasing it- even if that means waiting a week or two .   they also have a facebook page that shares great information for beer enthusiasts .   interested in brewing your own ?   the wb has got you covered with all you could possibly need to build your own mini-brewery in your garage or garden shed . 
__label__5 undisputed best beer selection in the whole metro area !  i stopped in on a whim saturday and was bowled over by the choices .  me=kid .  this place=candy store .  there is no way simone ' s even compares .  the great thing is that they use so little space for run of the mill commercial beer ,  that the small space they do have is not wasted one inch .    i got moerlein emancipator doppelbock from cincinnati .  and i got southern star blonde bombshell .  in cans !  i ' m a collector of cool cans and these are some of the coolest ever .  i admit that i shopped purely by graphic design and tried to come in under 9 bucks per six .  a lot of the imported stuff was around ten dollars a six pack .  there ' s so much more i want to try .  i am going to have to make a habit of coming back east more often just to shop here .  oh ,  and see family . 
__label__2 well where to begin .  bought a kenmore refrigerator told the delivery would be on october 8th .  took the day off from work  (  used a vacation day )  .  was called the evening before and told that the delivery was pushed back to the 15th .   (  no explanation ,  no additional price reduction to make up for the inconvenience ,  and no true apology )  .   when the refrigerator arrived they had to travel through the living room into the kitchen to install .  it was raining outside and they did not even attempt to put down plastic or any type of covering over our carpet .  ran the dolly through the mud and tracked it in with their shoes and dolly .   carpet was a total mess .  no apologies  or consideration for the mess they left .  i had to rent a carpet cleaner and clean the carpet .   the refrigerator was nice though .  but sears has really gone down in customer service since i have worked there 11 years ago . 
__label__5 bought a squall jacket for my wife ' s birthday at this sear ' s after researching the internet ,  for over an hour ,  for a jacket that would be good for fall weather in ne ohio .  land ' s end was the only " label" that makes a nice woman ' s squall that fits the bill .  it was great to actually see the jacket instead of a picture !  the color ,  the lining ,  the quality of the material made all the difference to me in picking the gift .  it certainly helped that the gentleman knew that there were 2 different versions of the jacket ,  since what i was initially looking at was not the style i wanted .  can ' t say enough good things about this store ! 
__label__1 please please do not call sears customer repair to service your appliance .  they have no idea what to do or how to perform a diagnostic .  they came to my home on three different occasions .  my refrigerator would not get cold and would very in temperature within different sections .  they ordered parts and was still was not able to fix my refrigerator .  i had to to tell show them after they supposedly diagnosed the problem that the ice maker and water dispenser did not work .   on two different occasions they missed appointment and never called to reschedule until i called them inquiring about why they missed appointment .  on one occasion i had to take off work for four hours and they still never showed up . 
__label__4 wonderful atmosphere .  the service is fast and dedicated .  my only recommendation would be less death music .  .  . flossie knows her craft
__label__5 really love this place !  it ' s such a cool swanky little bar to grab drinks before or after dinner !  takes some time to get your drinks but that ' s because their all craft made delicious cocktails .   they have a little private room which is nice if you have a larger party .  .  .  we drank in there for my birthday comfortably fits around 12 but we we ' re able to fit around 16 .   on the weekends they have jazzy like live music which completes the vibe .   for my husband the best part of society lounge is they serve pappy van winkle
__label__4 their drink menu is out of sight .  if you somehow don ' t find what you want out of their dozen or so page menu ,  then just ask for it .  they have skilled bar tenders who know how to go off menu like a champ .    the area is dark  ( borderline too dark )  and intimate .  it was perfect for something different to do on a date night .    the service was a little slower and less attentive than what i was expecting for the price ,  but when you could get their attention ,  they were friendly . 
__label__5 big place ,  cozy seating ,  and they have a great drink selection .  good place to grab drinks after dinner in the fall and winter . 
__label__5 this place is so me .  i was so thrilled to discover this place when visiting my parents .  they care deeply about their craft here ,  and it shows .  they make complex drinks in a very approachable way .  the staff are knowledgable and able to recommend drinks for picky drinkers .  we had quite a handful of cocktails here ,  and all were excellent .  the place had a real buzz -- the kind that only comes from a happy clientele .  a lounge singer provided some not-too-intrusive entertainment that fit the scene .  highly recommended for a drink before or after a show or dinner nearby . 
__label__1 sitting waiting on my drink for 25 minutes now .  waitress said 3 of 5 done .  great .  .  .   music is terrible .  i appreciate the nostalgia ,   however ,  at least try to parallel modern days .  i ' m dying to leave .   will slam my drink so i can go ,  if i can ever get one . 
__label__4 it ' s a cool spot .  loses some of the e4th feel being down the basement ,  but it ' s the vibe they are going for .  the speakeasy vibe complete with people standing on e4th to open the door for you .  classy .  very good creative cocktail menu .  limited food menu .  friendly bar back  ( who was busy cooking up on the bar a big pot of ginger for homemade ginger syrup )  .  bartender knew her drink menu and made them well .  i find the drinks served here slip the minds of bartenders in many other places ,  but she knew how to make them without thinking and did so in an enthralling manner .  they even have some drinks created by their head bartender that you won ' t find elsewhere .  definitely don ' t go hungry ,  but definitely do go check it out . 
__label__5 for a chinese this is one of places i can find authentic chinese food ,  more are the east region of china  ( shanghai etc )  instead of cantonese style food you see the most .  the price is reasonable and the portion is a lot !  if you dare to eat pig feet / organs  ( all authentic chinese food )  you can find them here !  : )  they have two types of menus: one is for authentic chinese food ( in chinese ) ; one is for americanized chinese food (  in english )  .  they also have a photo menu which maybe good for people wanna order authentic chinese food without knowing chinese . 
__label__3 typical chinese decor .  typical regional food ,  but that also means you may not find much of what other chinese places offer .  the food ' s never bowled me over ,  but it ' s also not bad .   but the spring rolls are some of the best in cleveland .  thin ,  crispy ,  not oily .  worth ordering just them for pick up . 
__label__1 i did not dine in here but had someone bring me back some takeout .  i ordered one of my favorite dishes beef lo mein and couldn ' t wait to tear into it .  no sooner then i tasted my first forkful did i spit it right back out .  it was so heavily salted that it was completely inedible .  foolishly i took another taste hoping i just grabbed a bad bite and was punished yet again .  this is the sort of experience i find inexcusable and will not be giving them a second chance .  people used to like this place but it clearly is on a major decline .  go elsewhere for your chinese food fix ,  there are plenty of better options around . 
__label__4 best authentic chinese food you ' ll find here besides the dim sum places around asia plaza . 
__label__5 great food for a price you cannot beat !  these people make me feel welcome all the time !  i have been living in this area for a few weeks and i have been their at least 5 times . i will continue to go back knowing the people who works here treats me like family
__label__4 had the reuben sandwhich defiantly enough for two .  everything was good and the waitress was honest about what we should order ,  which was very helpful .  i would come again . 
__label__2 why 2 stars ?  because the memories didn ' t match the quality .      ---   ---   ---  today starts a very long string of reviews compiled from a year of several trips outside the tampa bay area .  panini ' s somehow got skipped over the last time i reviewed spots on my last cleveland trip .   in parts of 2005 and 2006 i lived in cleveland and remember panini ' s being one of the greatest sandwiches i had ever had .  i ' m not sure if the quality has gone down in the last few years ,  or if the sandwich ' s deliciousness was just aided by a few rum-n-cokes .  .  .  but it was definitely not what i remembered .   it ' s kind of like in the movie 500 days of summer where they show "fantasy" and "reality" side by side when joseph gordon-levitt goes to see zooey deschanel at a party .   fantasy:  the juiciest ,  meatiest sandwich that causes me to act like the girls in an old herbal essence commercial .  butterflies ,  puppy dogs ,  and the cleveland indians winning the world series !  !   reality:  a dry sandwich ,  eaten in a dark ,  atmosphere-less bar ,  served by an un-amused waitress .  my three friends sitting in a booth with me ,  wondering why i brought them here . 
__label__4 andrew made my panini & it was solid .  good place for drinks & the kind of food you want to eat when you ' re drunk .  it gets super crowded after all the bars nearby close & people want drunk munchies .  go a couple hours before closing time to avoid that crowd
__label__4 great low key locals sort of spot to catch a game ,  play some pool / darts ,  or get a few cheap drinks .  the beer is cold ,  and the specials are good .  the bar doesn ' t serve food ,  but you are welcome to bring in food from any of the multitude of places around it .  there is also a decent patio tucked behind the place . 
__label__1 the salmon was the fishyest thing ever and the service was lacking .    in my party of around 13 people ,  at least 7 of the dishes were sent back for various reasons ,  usually the unpleasant smell from the salmon ,  but also things like rock hard burger buns .   if you come here ,  expect a bar-food experience ,  not sit down dining restaurant experience . 
__label__2 i ' ve been forced to go here for office happy hours .  consistently the service is lacking ,  the drinks are overpriced and served in small plastic cups ,  and the food is nothing worth mentioning .  last time we visited a full on fist fight broke out and the cops were called .  it was almost as good entertainment as the mechanical bull .  i give this restaurant an extra star bc it has a great location ,  outdoor space and so much potential .  i would honestly like to see it succeed and overcome .  .  . 
__label__5 would absolutely go back !  thai is very good and fun too !  i got a gel full set and it ' s exactly how i wanted . 
__label__4 so ,  we came in after blue point same day .   had a lot of food and drink ,  wanted a taste of this place had great friend ,  and friend of friends tells us of this great italian  eatery !   well i wanted to try this place just because it ' s walk down ,  like of the street type place ,  old school ,  made me think old school cleveland ,  well soon as we got down and in ,  it ' s small ,  like a basement ,  very nice ,  not uncle vito type ,  but what you expect if you have funds ,  not bar type ,  any whoo ,  lots of great wine choices !   we had the 2 best c glasses of wine !   they were pricy but completly  organic ,  and labeled exact !   like i like chianti ' s ,  totally had the chicken ,  or rooster or whatever ,  to show the exact region those grapes come from ,  on the neck of the bottle ,   great bartender !   so stop in or walk down in its great ! 
__label__4 this place is a gem .  for ambiance ,  its easily the best in the warehouse district .   tucked away ,  dark ,  live frank sinatra music ,  and a cozy romantic date atmosphere you won ' t find anywhere else in this neighborhood .   my boyfriend and i shared the buffalo mozzarella w / prosciutto appetizer which was delicious .   for entrees we had the ossobucco and the duck pasta special .  the ossobucco was very good .  the duck pasta was also good and they did not skimp at all on the duck ,  but nothing about it was unique- certainly not enough to be a $30 dish .   and thats the only gripe i have about this place ,  the food is good but lacks the complexity of flavor or creativity to justify the cost .   an app ,  two entrees and a  ( cheap )  bottle of wine put us at around $150 ,  which is just not what the food was worth .   if the atmosphere weren ' t so great ,  i would rate this as a 3 star .  take that for what its worth .   i won ' t be back often ,  but i am glad to know there is a cute ,  romantic little italian place in my neighborhood for special nights . 
__label__3 good service ,  good food ,  pretty expensive for what you get .  we got the crustini appetizer which was very good .  i got the veal tortellini and it was tasty but pretty greasy sauce .  i would have appreciated some bread .  my boyfriend got the tenderloin and it was very well prepared . 
__label__5 went there this past saturday and was treated like i grew up with the owner .  .  .  .  .  .  . recommend the torttolini w /  prociutto .  .  .  .  . very nice .  .  .  . one in our party did not like their gnocchi and it was quickly replaced with an order or torttolini .  .  .  .  .  .   short walk to the new casino where i got clipped for 50 . 00 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
__label__4 loved the service ,  food and wine list !   when i tried to make a reservation i was only able to get the back room that is usually a private party .  since we were 7 with 2 children it was fine .   as usual the kids got the best service and this made our dining experience wonderful .  the shrimp and lobster with cheese tortilinni was a table favorite .   our only regret was sharing dessert with my grandson .  .  . he shared a strep throat with us ,  really ! 
__label__4 went there this week for dinner while on a business trip ,  sat at the bar .  very crowded ,   some tables very noisy ,  but hey: as long as they ' re having fun .  i started with the beef carpaccio and then had the veal tortellini .  the carpaccio was awesome: sliced very thin and a nice touch adding some finely chopped onions and some parsley .  the veal tortellini were good .  .  .  not great .  i was a little concerned about the service .  several servers approached my while sitting at the bar ,  apparently unaware if i had already ordered or not .  then when i wanted to ask for some parmesan cheese it took me like 10 minutes to get someones attention .  the owner  ( or manager ?  )  seemed more interested in providing superior service to the table of 8 rather than checking if the guy at the bar needs anything .  all in all a good dinner ,  hope they will find a way around the service issues . 
__label__1 in short ,  extremely overpriced !   the menu offers  ' primi '  and  ' secondi '  ,   ( firsts and seconds )  but they charge entree pricing  ( $25 -$40 each )  .  by the time you eat your app and first  ( pasta )  ,  you have no room for a second  ( meats / seafood )  not that you would want one because you ' d be at $75 per person for food that ' s a notch above olive garden .   we ordered ravioli that was cold in parts without any fresh taste .   the second ,  veal osso buco ,  which is braised with the expectation of tenderness ,  was so tough and bland .   i ' m almost sure that that was not even veal .   veal is always tender !  at this point i was looking to at the least be pleased through a desert so i risked the $9 on a glorified piece of chocolate cake .   unimpressive !   to boot the decor was as cheesy as the lounge singers and idiot patron stumbling / dancing in front of him . 
__label__2 alright ,  but very expensive for what you get .  pork was way over cooked ,  almost like rubber but the apps were good .  i would go somewhere else and others in the party agreed . 
__label__2 this was my first time visiting this underground establishment .  my better half and i had a "living social" deal ,  so we figured we had nothing to lose .    we sat at the bar because the dining area was booked with reservations .  which was not a problem for us .  totally understandable for a saturday night .    after taking out spots at the bar we were greeted with a wine list the size of a bible .  a little intimated we both opted for a perioni  ( beer )  since we were here to eat i figured the bartender would offer us a food menu .  .  .  .  .  .  . wrong .  i saw a menu sitting on the bar and grabbed it .  we both looked it over before the bartender asked "oh are you two eating here ? " we both ordered .  i ordered the gnocchi  ( $22 )  .  after a while .  .  .  .  .  it came out of the kitchen .  i thought they gave me the children portion .  extremely smaller than i expected for the price .  the taste was average at best .  very disappointed .    in conclusion: cool atmosphere ,  unfriendly service and small portions considering the price . 
__label__4 very nice discovery .  a manhattan feel to this italian restaurant .  a date night is a good match for this place .  great service combined with a diverse menu .  pasta dishes were tasty and plentiful .  wine list plentiful and reasonable .  not much not to like here . 
__label__2 excited to try merchant but disappointed in the quality of customer service .   the staff seemed less than exuberant to wait on customers .   with such an amazing view of the park ,  and on taste of tremont day ,  none the less ,  my expectations were set high but were ,  unfortunately ,  not met .    i would not recommend
__label__5 this place is clean ,  the staff is friendly and the food has always been great .   being up in cleveland heights for the summer ,  i will miss it when i leave ,  the salads are awesome with a pita under the salad .  everything i have eaten there has been great ! 
__label__2 this is best gyro is very convenient ,  and clean .  now with that being said ,  the morning crew is very rude and impatient .  doors open up at 10am ,  i arrived at 10:02 am ,  i asked the older guy if he wanted a few more minutes to continue to "set up" .  after he rolled his eyes ,  took several deep breaths he says; let ' s go ,  let ' s go ,  i got other things to do let go with the order !  didn ' t appreciate the way he talked to me an my wife .  so the hell with this  place for breakfast .   i recommend late night food with a better group of employees . 
__label__5 great customer service and free wifi !  !  !  !  my salad was very fresh ! 
__label__5 my absolute favorite shop in all of cleveland !  most amazing staff .  most amazing items .    go at christmas ,  it is becoming my tradition ,  they hang ornaments from the ceiling starting black friday .  you go in pick out your ornament and they cut it down for you and box it up in pretty wrapping .   true gem .   as a note ,  the prices are pretty high- and certainly out of my price range but 2 christmases ago i picked out several handmade beautiful ornaments .  the owner was there as i admired three and finally decided i could only justify spending that much money on two ornaments and would have to leave the last one for someone else .  he noticed this and cut the 3rd down and gave it to me for free .    i can ' t always afford all the items i want but there are not many stores that truly appreciate your patronage this way anymore .  if i am going to spend money id prefer to spend it supporting a local treasure like this one . 
__label__5 i love something different .  it is one of the first places i visited moving to the w .  25th area 5 years ago and i have been coming back ever since .    george and koula are the kindest people you will ever meet .  they are genuine ,  caring and offer a wide variety of amazing goods - many by local artists .    every time i come in they greet me by name and treat me so wonderfully .  if you are looking for fun ,  unique gifts or just wanting to meet fantastic proprietors ,  this is your place ! 
__label__5 first time doing a review but the customer service at something different was so good i had to spread the word .  i was looking for a gift for my mom ' s 60th birthday and the owner showed personally showed me around asking what my mom likes and showed me gifts that were tailored to her interest .  can ' t say enough about how nice and enjoyable it was to shop here .  i will be telling everyone i know to stop in ! 
__label__5 i got a lot of my christmas shopping out of the way in a very short amount of time here .  plus free gift wrapping !  they had some really great deals and something special for everyone .  lastly ,  the staff was amazing !  !  !  some of the best customer service i have every experienced .  it ' s worth a stop . 
__label__5 these ladies are the best !  every time i walk in there ,  they make me feel welcome .  i especially love going in there this time of year because of all of the christmas ornaments hanging from the ceiling .  you never know what you ' ll find .  i ' ve gotten a wrap ,  mugs ,  chocolates and tonight i got myself a new hat .  they were even nice enough to give my husband and i a house warming gift .  a cute house ornament .  we love coming in here ,  great service and always something different . 
__label__3 i just read rachel b ' s review and definitely agree .  it ' s kind of cool that it ' s a cute little place but then again it ' s so small that you do get the feeling that you ' re intruding .  the food was pretty good .  we got the chicken teriyaki and ginger pork on rice .  it was really cold that day .  i would like to try out the garden sometime .  i ' ll probably be back again and write another review . 
__label__5 i would highly recommend everything by face .  every time i leave the salon i am completely satisfied .  my friends and coworkers compliment me on my eyebrows and nails .  i love chelle and her work is excellent !   you won ' t be disappointed . 
__label__1 i bought the $19 groupon for the individual mink eyelashes .  terrible !  !  to start ,  their listed number was discontinued .  then when i found the right number i was not able to schedule an appointment for weeks .  they were rude and unaccommodating and so my groupon ended up expiring .  i had to pay more to get the lashes when i could finally get an appointment and they only lasted 3 days !  !  !  i ' ve gotten mink lashes before and never had an issue .  terrible service !  !  terrible product !  !  never again ! 
__label__4 as an independent theater ,  they obviously don ' t have the newest movies all the time ,  but i think that ' s one of the things that makes this a "fun" theater .  every time i go here ,  the people at the ticket window are so nice .  last night i went to a show and it was my first time being in the theater on the second floor .  it was for the new captain phillips movie ,  and while really not that many people attended for a newer movie on a friday night ,  the upstairs theater was very small .  .  .  hard to find a "good seat" ,  so if you know that you ' re going to end up in that one ,  i would try to get there early .   many people love that they sell beer here ,  which i really don ' t get because then you ' ll be needing to use the bathroom in the middle of the movie ,  and maybe more ,  right .  .  !  ?  it is a clean theater with a very nice staff .  one time they had started a movie too early by mistake and at first i was upset that i missed the beginning ,  but they made it right by restarting the movie for everyone so those who were still on time but had missed the beginning got to see the entire thing .  i go here whenever i can !  they have a great old-time movie theater atmosphere . 
__label__5 capitol theatre is a great place to see movies .  eventhough the screen in the upper theaters is not as large as new theaters ,  you do not even notice once the movie has started .  everything is up to date pertaining to sound ,  picture quality ,  etc .  so it is still an amazing movie experience .  i love how you can always get a ticket and don ' t have to worry about a bunch of teenagers running around on a friday night .  it is great to be able to walk into old world cleveland .  the renovations are amazing ,  so it is definitely worth checking out .   keep it local and go to the capitol theatre !

__label__5 as rachel mentioned in her earlier review ,  being new to cleveland ,  i was not privvy to the previous capitol incarnation ,  but i can say i sure love this version !   i was brought here for the last two movies i ' ve seen in cleveland  ( tron and true grit )  and was immediately taken in by the wonderful restoration .   the main theater hearkens back to a previous era where people dressed up to go out to dinner and a movie; with classical sconces hanging from the walls and quite the impressive ceiling medallion .   the seats were very comfy ,  the screen large enough to make you feel as if you were in the film  ( especially with the 3d )  and the sound system was as good as any new-built theater i ' ve been in .   at our last visit ,  we were upstairs in one of the smaller theaters for true grit .   pretty decent screen size but if you happen to be taller than my height  ( 5 ' 4" )  you probably want to get there early to ensure you sit in the few rows they have with a little more leg space .   my movie companion was visibly uncomfortable through much of the show due to the close placement of the row in front of us .   i love the indie spirit of this cinema ,  on select sunday ' s they run classic movies in the main theater  ( at 10 am )  and they also have ifc midnight showings .   the late shift films presented by melt are also a bonus  ( i ' ll definitely be there for the viewing of m*a*s*h* this month !  )  .   if money is an issue ,  check them out on $5 mondays or student discount thursdays .   also be sure to browse the flyers sitting by the door on your way out .  .  .  . i discovered one of my favorite musicals will be playing in town for my birthday when i randomly picked up a flyer for the near west theater .   given the choice ,  i ' d much rather support a local theater than a country-wide conglomerate ,  and from the size of the audience packed into true grit this past weeked ,  it looks like many people in the community are doing their part to support this landmark as well !   i anticipate many returns to both the capitol and the cedar lee in these cool winter months . 
__label__4 for those who couldn ' t tell by the address ,  this one is the brooklyn branch .  this branch has a somewhat unique layout compared to other libraries in the metro area .  the selection is about average for libraries around cleveland and is somewhat less crowded than many other locations .    one major complaint i have for this specific library is that due to the open layout ,  it tends to get a bit loud during busier times so it isn ' t ideal for studying .  other than that ,  i highly recommend it .  i usually go to the parma south library but this one is also a good choice . 
__label__4 there are several sub shops nearby ,  but this place is my favorite !   the meatball sub is messy ,  but is very satisfying on these cool fall days . 
__label__4 crusty bread ,  copious banana peppers ,  dousing of "dave ' s special sauce" aka italian dressing ,  and cucumbery pickles .  eff yeah .    i ' ve been eating at dave ' s original chagrin falls location since i was in high school  ( 10 years or so )  ,  and i ' m a little embarassed to say that i ' ve only ever ordered the turkey dave ,  because it ' s so delightful .  .  .  why stray from a classic ? 
__label__5 delicious .   wonderful .   great .   priced right .   good food .   thoroughly enjoy . 
__label__1 poor hosting .  none cares if you walk in and you gotta wander around i bet .  they clean and vacuum the floor while we were having food ,  that ' s most ridiculous .  that oldie manager got some renovation going on while customers were having food ,  that ' s sick .  biryani is good though . 
__label__1 very bad experience .  the floors although wooden have holes in them .  there is no host .  we were seated and had to wait 5 minutes to menus ,  silverware and had to ask for water glasses .  when we were seated there was a water jug from the previous people who must ' ve sat at the table we were sitting .  there was only 1 waiter who was serving 4 tables and was very slow .  took 20 minutes for our food to come and they forgot to bring out the dosas .  as much as the food is good the ambiance needs much improvement .  looks like renovations were being done and are incomplete .  they didn ' t have any music on to liven the atmosphere .  no one came to check on to see how everything was once the food had arrived .  i asked for less spicy food and the head chef cane and said its not possible .  in my opinion this isn ' t a restaurant i ' ll be visiting again unless they make some improvements !  ! 
__label__4 this is one my go to places when i crave for indian food .  .  i have been here quite a few times and this place never fails to surprise me .  . 
__label__5 stayed here while i was in town on business because it was very close to the airport and a convenient location for other amenities  ( food ,  shopping ,  etc .  )  .   the manager was on site and very friendly .   the rooms were spotless and the beds were comfortable .   i would definitely stay here again ! 
__label__5 stopped in here for some all day breakfast .  when i first walked in i was a little skeptical because of the typical old fashioned diner decor but i was pleasantly surprised .  i ordered the super 8 with chocolate chip pancakes ,  a coffee and a chocolate milkshake .  pancakes were perfect and the coffee was very good .  great value - only $5 . 50 for 2 eggs ,  2 pancakes ,  2 bacon slices and 2 sausages .  the staff and even the other patrons were very friendly .  i would definitely go back again but this time would order only a huge stack of pancakes . 
__label__5 i have to say for a tiny place you might miss if you blink .  .  .  the breakfast was amazing perfect bacon eggs and the grits yummy !  !  if you ' re ever in this neighborhood stop by . 
__label__5 within a mile and a half stretch of road on the cleveland ' s east side are about 4 family restaurants .  sheas and landmark included .  you can never ever go wrong with any of them but when it comes to bang for your buck angela ' s blows them out of the water .  great speedy food with friendly staff that make you feel not only at home but as if you ' re actually a part of the family .  i always recommend the deluxe 12 to people as its an amazing deal that ' s so inexpensive you aren ' t even mad if you can ' t finish it . 
__label__1 don ' t do it .  not even on a drunk night .   .  .  just go to bed and eat something in the morning .  pizza & fries inedible .  the only food option open late keeps this place alive .  one star for the people-watching . 
__label__4 this market is definitely more expensive than your average grocery store ,  but i enjoyed shopping here for some lunch items .  we wanted to enjoy a meal outside and the market has several prepared foods .  they have some pasta salads ,  a salad bar ,  wraps ,  veggies and fruit .   i actually really enjoyed my hummus and veggie wrap !   it had a little too much hummus ,  but it had fresh lettuce and red peppers .   we also got some organize lemonade that i would stop in to get again on a hot day .   they have some of the staples as well .  it ' s well organized and i ' m sure it ' s nice to have a grocery store on campus for those who go to school at cwru .   definitely worth checking out when you ' re in the uptown neighborhood ! 
__label__3 i think i only like the idea of this place due to convenience .  most items are a little pricey for my taste and i can ' t bring myself to come here often .  of course ,  it depends on what you ' re buying and what you ' re used to paying .  it ' s all relative .    the beer selection is wide and varied and they do have the essentials that would press me to come here quickly on my walk home from work .  it seems like their fresh prepared food options are good too ,  so i ' m not opposed to giving those a try .    generally ,  though ,  i ' d rather drive to a grocery store that won ' t hurt my wallet so much .  granted ,  the case population will benefit greatly from this snazzy little addition  ( along with all of the other uptown additions )  .  i ' d just rather go to a market in little italy if i ' m going to walk somewhere for my beer or milk . 
__label__2 way over priced ,  some of the items are twice as much ,  and i ' m not even comparing to marc ' s ,  but whole foods !  i ' m sure they do fine they as they can monopolize on the area of students from the surrounding three schools . 
__label__1 wasn ' t aware that i needed to ask to have the things i paid for placed in a bag .  i know a lot of the traffic here is made up of students who have backpacks to carry things ,  but maybe offer to bag things regardless considering that ' s your job ?  lazy and rude is a bad combination . 
__label__3 good greasy spoon in downtown .   had pancakes ,  hash browns and water for $5 .   they were very tasty and affordable .   place isn ' t the fanciest ,  and they do not have a bathroom ,  they suggest you go across the street to a hotel . 
__label__4 quick ,  not too greasy ,  delicious eggs ,  loved this place .   staff are very nice . 
__label__4 came here with my wife and enjoyed  a great meal .   the place is very clean and the workers are super friendly .   had to wait 5 minutes for our sandwich ,  but at least it was made fresh . 
__label__4 i have the answer to any new years resolution diet: philly cheese steak .    yes ,  that ' s right .  one my first days of 2011 was spent scarfing one of these bad boys down and wiping the grease off my chin--with a side of fresh cut fries and a lemonade ,  no less .    i know it ' s a chain ,  and i don ' t indulge all the time ,  but dagnabbit penn station cooks up a mighty fine sub .  the fresh bread is friggin '  delish ,  toasted to perfection and holds all the delectable toppings inside perfectly .  cheesy steak ,  grilled onions ,  mushrooms ,  hot peppers ,  lettuce and tomato all folded up .  .  .  .  is it bad that my mouth is watering right now ?    you can actually watch them cooking your food right in front of you ,  all fresh .  not to mention fresh cut fries with malt vinegar prepared while you wait for your sandwich .    lemonade squeezed homemade .  yeah ,  that ' s not a complete sentence ,  but i feel that it speaks for itself . 
__label__5 - if it ' s nye ?  i ' m at suite sixx ,  but ,  any other weekend night i ' m at drop bar .  lovely atmosphere great drinks with actual bartenders that know how to make many different kinds .  they have good music ,  men that know how to act / dress ,  classy females great place to try to meet a girl on friday night  ( not too crowded ,  good chance for one on one convo .  )  , it ' s a great place to go meet friends on a saturday night ,  and on sundays great day for a date .  i ' ve done all three .  i love this place .  the only truly classy place left on w . 6th street . 
__label__3 decor: i was very skeptical of this new spot because i did not think it was possible to improve on the mercury lounge  ( original design )  .  .  .  .   mercury was one of the only nightclubs in town that was designed by a proper architect and interior designer ,  etc .  .   but the decor is actually very well put together and the new layout  ( although almost exactly laid out like mercury )  is just different enough to create a whole new vibe .   two thumbs way up - gorgeous spot .   service: main bar was slow ,  made me curious about how functional the back bar is for the bartenders ,  or they were just really slow bartenders .   mini bar near the dance floor was a better option and the bartender was a sweetheart .    music / lights: music was great ,  i was there on a saturday .  best music on the street if youre into interesting stuff .   sound system was either not eq ' d properly ,  had limiters on it ,  or i dont know what .  it was also a lot brighter than i like my bars ,  but thats just me .  those are my only complaints .    i would have stayed longer if it weren ' t for that .  .  .  but i plan to stop back .  .  .  maybe on a different day of the week .  i am sure they are still ironing out some kinks .    clientele:  i was surprised that the sat night clientele was just like the old euro night clientele .  .  .  not sure if its like that all the time or if it was just the night i went . 
__label__3 so much fun !   lots of crafts and booths - unfortunately ,  some of the items seemed more like pre-made items rather than handmade authentic greek crafts .   the food looked great ,  but we didn ' t get to try any .   maybe next time ,  which will definitely bump up the star rating ! 
__label__5 been looking forward to this event as much as i look forward to true blood coming out every summer .  this is a great family oriented event which is pretty much a staple for the city for many years .  the amount of planning and effort that goes into this event is immeasurable .  plenty of greek music ,  dancing ,  eating and drinking to be had .   foods to try: loukoumades  ( greek donuts )  ,  dolmades  ( stuffed grape leaves )  ,  pastitsio  ( greek lasagna )  ,  spanakopita  ( spinach pie )  and their gyro ' s are always good  ( even for picky kids ,  they tend to love them )  .    see you there this weekend !  just be prepared ,  parking is a nightmare ,  like everywhere else in tremont . 
__label__1 i work next to this building and pass this place everyday .  went in for the first time today and will never go back .  i ordered a blt and some fries .  the lettuce had brown spots in it like a bug ate through it .  why would you serve that to a customer .  whoever puts that lettuce on had to have clearly saw that .  they served my food in a styrofoam box no paper to line it or anything so my fries and blt had melted the box .  so not only do you have bug caves in your lettuce you have styrofoam melted in your food not a good place to eat .  the toast for the sandwich was cold it was the bacon and the hot fires that took the brunt of the styrofoam .  my friend ordered the onion rings and a burger she said the burger was average but for 6$ you can get a better burger anywhere and they served her four onion rings she only ate two because they were gross .    while we were waiting for our food i walked over to the salad bar to check out what kind of things they have hoping that since this place is so close i could come back one day until a waitress in broken english said that is for the salad bar not for you .  seriously lady ,  i am a professional adult women not a child .    to top it off they dont even take cash and dont even make that known until you have already been rang up .  if i knew that i would have prepared and not spent 2 . 50 at the bar next door .  i wouldnt eat here again if they were giving the food away . 
__label__5 i rolled in on addy ' s and found a perfect breakfast place here in cle .   the coffee is surprisingly good for a diner .  the veggie omelette was great and inexpensive .   the waitress was nice and brought my food quickly along with the coffee .  as i love finding locally owned breakfast places ,  this is perfect for me ,  and i will be returning when i come back to cle . 
__label__4 cute little gift shop / boutique in the ohio city section of cleveland .  .  .  .   they have a wide variety of home decor  ( small pieces of art work )  ,  candles ,  jewelry ,  greeting cards and other really fun stuff .   when i visited i purchased a few cool midwestern pride greeting cards to send to my friends who have left the area  ( and of course make them home sick )  as well as a pretty reusable glass water bottle that i can ' t wait to take to work or use it for a picnic .   the prices are a little high ,  but its well worth it to support a small ,  locally owned business .  it is a great place to buy something special for yourself or a special person in your life ! 
__label__5 an incredible place to pick up gifts for the quirky person in your life or just to grab something fun for yourself .  they have a great selection of novelty items and most everything is made locally . 
__label__2 felt a theme in the ohio city area ,  some nice stores to browse but items on the pricey side ,  i don ' t feel 30 / 40 t-shirts are a good deal ,  plus prints feel like they are at least 5-20 dollars over what one might pay .   i guess it ' s a buyers market ,  i saw people not buying anything so take it for what it ' s worth  ( perhaps nothing )  .   wouldn ' t return unless there was a legit sale of some sort . 
__label__3 a nice place to stop for lunch if you ' re in parma heights for some reason ,  but i can ' t help but shake the feeling that this place could be on "restaurant: impossible" some day .   the menu is a mix of greek ,  italian ,  "americana" diner fare ,  and some hungarian  /  polish treats .   ( it ' s northeast ohio .  of course there are pierogies .  )  i ended up trying the stuffed cabbage rolls for lunch and found them pretty good ,  especially at the daily special price of $8 ,  but not really over the top .  the meal also came with home fries ,  which were interesting - it looked like the potatoes were cut into long strips and then cooked on the flat top rather than being diced up or fried - almost like a gigantic fluffy potato pancake .   service was fine but kind of distracted .  i noticed the waitress was trying to manage her kids at the same time as taking care of her tables .    decor is .  .  . mixed .  carpeted floors ,  a buffet that looks like it was turned off and left in place ,  a bunch of flags all over the place ,  and a few tvs .  to go with the r:i theme ,  it feels like the whole place is really unfocused .  someone working to re-focus the menu and the appearance of the restaurant would go a long ,  long way . 
__label__5 so let me just say ,  this place is amazing .  if you want to try something new ,  but don ' t want your typical cupcake or cake .  .  get the yum yum cake .  i ' ve never had anything like this in my life .  it ' s not overly sweet .  just enough to fill your sweet fix .  it ' s not dry ,  very moist and full of flavor .  their cheese cake is amazing .  i ' ve made the jello ones when i ' m really craving it ,  but this is worth the drive for me .  sometimes cheese cake leaves an after taste in your mouth ,  this one makes me wanna eat more .  their cookie shots are saweet !  get it with superman ice cream  ( they have the real stuff )  .  strawberry delight cupcake .  .  .  that fits the name .  it is a strawberry inside of a yellow cupcake  ( he puts an added touch to his cupcakes btw )  .  and it ' s whip cream on the top instead of icing ,  then a strawberry drizzle on the top .  gone in 3 bites .  red velvet truffles .  .  .  who knew something so simple could be addictive .  i love red velvet and it ' s hard to find a good rv cake .  but in a truffle ,  bite size .  .   you have no idea what you ' re in for .  boba tea ,  i love this .  you can get it with the flavor burst balls instead of the tapioca balls .  personally i like the tapioca ,  but the flavor burst ones .  .  there ' s different flavors and it ' s like added fun with each sip .  and i saved the best for last .  their hawaiian guri guri .  i have no idea how to describe this .  it ' s not ice cream ,  but it ' s not like a snow cone .  it ' s just soft ice goodness that a small cup won ' t do any justice .  i had the orange and savored every minute .   the owner are amazing and so friendly and their story behind this business is just amazing .  worth the drive .  you have to pay for parking there .  the side streets are always packed .  it ' s not expensive parking either ,  so no big deal .  the eating area is small and cute and very homey .  like a picnic .  can ' t wait to go back !  ! 
__label__5 for all crossfitters looking to drop in .  .  . this is your box .   if you don ' t know about crossfit and you want to try it out ,  this is the place to be .   i ' m an out of towner ,  live in nyc and travel every week to clients around the us .   i ' m on contract in cleveland and have visited most of the surrounding boxes in the area .  in addition i ' ve seen a variety of crossfit gyms around the nation from the small box in a garage to the top of the line 15 , 000 square feet spaces with state of the art features and amenities .   i ' m pretty harsh on my opinions of certain boxes ,  but i ' ll tell you that crossfit cle has a great combination of community ,  experienced coaches ,  facility ,  equipment and upholds in my opinion as a top notch gym .   one thing that made me connect more than anything here was the level of standards that the coaches uphold ,  specifically ,  phil and regina .   first day i was there ,  no repped doing burpees ,  because they couldn ' t hear my clap .  .  . i knew right then and there that this is the box .  .  . it ' s been great ever since .   solid coaching ,  from the beginner level to the experienced athlete they cover a broad spectrum of coaching tips and cues .   good programming with quality warm ups and mobility focus .   a class act business with the right tools to make your crossfit experience that much better .   if you are new to the crossfit world ,  i ' d highly recommend walking into the box to say hi and get a feel for this community and gym . 
__label__4 the rocky river reservation is awesome .  tons of gorgeous hiking trails that look spectacularly different with each changing season .    some tips for coming here with kids:  - pack a picnic and lay out a blanket at memorial field and enjoy .  : )   - collect pretty rocks down by the river !   - take a trip to the rocky river nature center - lots of activities and exhibits showcasing the area ' s history ,  complete with a very unique kid ' s play area in a giant hollow tree .    we ' re lucky to live in an area with such beautiful parks so close to home ! 
__label__5 placed around the city and surrounding towns in an effortless pattern ,  the metroparks are also referred to as the city ' s "emerald necklace . " running paths ,  bike paths ,  horse trails ,  winding rivers and streams ,  make up this one of a kind collection of parks .  you can ride ,  walk ,  or jog the 60 miles of paved paths ,  explore the various foot trails off the pavement ,  or perhaps participate in one of the many baseball / softball / soccer leagues that find their home in the parks .  go for a picnic or go to explore ,  but if you live in or visit the city of cleveland  ( or its surrounding communities )  just make sure you go !   i used to access the parks about 1 / 4 mile off of the baldwin-wallace campus for running and biking . 
__label__5 food was great and the service was better .  would highly recommend hatfields to everyone . 
__label__3 we ' ve been 4 times now and the food is good ,  but we really keep coming back for the great atmosphere and friendly staff .  from breakfast to pulled pork ,  food is consistently good ,  but on the very heavy side in my opinion .  i need more veggies in my life and can ' t find enough of them here !  one can not survive on pork alone - although some may argue otherwise and this place may be perfect for you !  not a huge fan of their drink selection or coffee .  the set up is a little awkward  ( order at bar ,  pick up in the back when the bell rings ,  are you supposed to clear your own table ?  you should still tip right ?  i don ' t know .  .  . awkward set up )  and some of the tables look great but are really uncomfortable to actually sit on .  worth a stop to check out of you ' re in the neighborhood though ! 
__label__5 great customer service very good food .  .  .  .  one thing about breakfast food that is always disappointing um is the lack of flavor in hash browns / breakfast potatoes .  .  . not here !  !  !  the breakfast potatoes are beyond flavorful .   i would highly suggest this restaurant .   decor is fun and interesting .   very comfortable .  .  .  . 
__label__5 i had been hearing about deering vintage for quite some time now and being the fashion lover that i am i figured it was about time i check this place out .   i had a little trouble finding the place  ( stupid iphone !  )  but my frustration disappeared the instant i stepped into this treasure chest !   i didn ' t know where to start - there were so many great pieces that caught my eye .   i was on a short time limit ,  but i was able to sift though quite a few racks and ended up finding an amazing 70 ' s cocktail dress to wear to a wedding i have coming up .  i also found a few pieces that i wanted to think about before making the impulse buy and i haven ' t stopped thinking since !     there is such a wide variety of clothing and i noticed quite a few designer pieces at really great prices .   and if you love vintage accessories ,  then this is the place for you because there is a huge collection that i definitely want to go check out when i have the time to really take it all in .    all in all ,  one of the best vintage stores i ' ve been to in any city ! 
__label__5 buttery goodness not always just for nipples scottish pastie joy  having walked by this stand at the westside market hundreds of times ,  i finally succumbed to scottish cuisine .   yeah ,  i had the munchies .   and having consumed literally thousands of brats and hot dogs i thought to go with something different .   so glad i did .   i ' ve had a variety of meat pies when i was in australia years ago and they were no great shakes ,  but these pasties and such are a whole different animal .     the crust is out of this world .   flakey ,  buttery and just the right amount of salt .   fillings range from chicken and vegetables to sausage patties to corned beef .   they are good stone cold ,  but warmed up ,  it is a real treat .  serious comfort food here folks .    serious comfort .   carry on ,  and have a pastie . 
__label__1 getting my wisdom teeth extracted by dr .  wazney was by far the worst decision i ' ve ever made .  the surgery itself went quickly and smoothly ,  but she sent me home with little to no instruction on after-care .  it has been over a week and i am still in excruciating pain .  my swelling was unlike anything i ' ve ever seen and i had cuts on the side of my mouth .  currently ,  i have shooting pains in all of my teeth ,  a jaw that won ' t open more than an inch ,  and tongue numbness that won ' t go away ,  presumably from dr .  wazney damaging my lingual nerve .  at my follow up appointment dr .  wazney barely looked in my mouth and handed me a syringe without any instruction on how to use it to clean my tooth sockets .  she is cold ,  rude ,  and the way she conducts surgery ensures the most painful and long recovery process .   i would never recommend this doctor and would definitely say she has provided the worst medical experience i ' ve had in my entire life .   update: i went to get a second opinion from a different surgeon .  turns out i had dry sockets for the entire week that dr .  wazney failed to treat me for .  the other surgeon also said my tongue may not recover for several months . 
__label__5 great mexican food at very reasonable prices .  fast service tables usually available even on saturdays . 
__label__3 shay ' s is an ok greasy spoon .  about average grease levels .   i came in here once to try it after having been dazzled next door at annie and earl ' s .  i got a belgian style waffle .  i got some strawberry topping and a coffee .  it was all alright ,  but came out to more than $7 ,  which to me seems pretty high for this kind of a place .   ambiance is "normal" for a greasy spoon diner .  as with every greasy diner in asiatown ,  the clientele is delightfully diverse . 
__label__2 one day i passed the time away reading cleveland food blogs .  as i am in this part of town several times a week i was happy to find bloggers praise shay ' s .  the old-fashioned platters of meat loaf ,  turkey ,  or roast beef served with gravy and mashed potatoes were described in mouth watering terms .  the cheeseburger was nothing short of a culinary discovery .  to add to the attraction bloggers claimed this was a place that served a highly diverse customer base .  economic and racial barriers are crossed at the shay counter ,  booths ,  and small tables .    on my one and only visit i found none of the above the least bit supported .  i did find my waitress friendly and helpful .  when asked she informed me shay ' s serves processed turkey .  not much is cheaper or easier than roast turkey but restaurants have latched on to processed turkey like a kardashian on a dollar .  i had hoped shay ' s did not .  the hamburger and fries were typical of those found at a restaurant food service .  as for diverse customers ,  on my visit i was the only diverse customer .    prices are very low ,  shay ' s offers plain old american food in an area with mostly asian restaurants .  the menu is loaded with favorite diner foods .  the premises are typical of an old luncheonette .  it has a lot going for it with one important exception ,  the food . 
__label__4 pretty good greasy spoon diner .  generous portions .  nice staff .  we are truck drivers and we eat where we can .  i review restaurants as to whether they fulfill what they aspire to be .  shay ' s has a nice ,  relaxed neighborhood diner feel with absolutely no pretentions .  no hipsters ,  just working folks like us .  they keep the hot coffee coming and have big pork chops and good blueberry pancakes .  one could do far worse . 
__label__4 shay ' s a pretty solid go to spot .  the food is always inexpensive ,  never greasy tasting ,  and they cook up some pretty good tasting turkey sausage .  parking is limited ,  but the nice size portions once you get your food makes up for it .  this place is definitely no ihop ,  which says alot if your tired of going to fast food chains .  shay ' s is as down home as it gets and for that reason i ' ll keep going back . 
__label__5 i am absolutely not a doughnut person .   not at all .   they ' re too sweet .  they taste like nothing .  and they leave me feeling like i ate lead .   not brewnuts .   i am pretty sure that these little bites of bliss are created by unicorns out of magic and beer .  they ' re fluffy ,  they ' re flavorful ,  and they leaving me wanting another one .   i love that the donut itself is not sweet ,  just flavorful .   yeasty and fluffy with a touch of beer taste ,  just enough to make it oh-so-delicious without making it taste less like a doughnut than a drink .  the glazes add another layer of flavor and just enough sweetness to make it decadent .     go eat a bunch of these and share them with your friends ,  neighbors ,  and relatives .  they will change the way you see doughnuts forever . 
__label__4 came here for a pre-screening of elysium last week and it was an enjoyable experience .  the theater has charm and character .  the ceiling in the screen room looks beautiful !  although this is an old style theater their electronics are updated .  the projector was sharp and sound was very good even though i was in the rear side of the theater .  i believe there are happy hour specials before 8pm on wednesdays  ( beer and wine are half off )  .  the theater also plays classic movies from time to time .  parking may be an issue on busy nights since the adjacent lot is a bit small . 
__label__5 ok--i ' m a little late to the party ,  but hey .  .  .  that ' s normal .  i mean ,  my motto just happens to be: "late for life . "  and by late i mean i have only been in the upstairs ,  smaller-size theaters .  i just assumed that they were all itty-bitty ,  but last night capitol proved me wrong .  the first floor theaters are huge ,  ornate and gorgeous !    also ,  the matinee prices are where it ' s at !  we had two adults and a kiddie for $19 .  not too shabby !  what really killed us was getting sodas ,  but it ' s not like capitol has more outrageous prices than any other theater .    i just feel better spending my money here and supporting local business .  and that just makes any movie experience feel that much better .    oh ,  and i love the new sign ! 
__label__5 there is no better burger .  anywhere !  !  betty ' s has the best .  when you see her around ,  go there immediately .  you ' ll friend her on facebook just so you too can become a betty groupie just like i am .  each year her menu changes a little bit ,  and oh my god does it change for the better !  !  !  !  i don ' t know how she does it but the burgers get better and better !  ! 
__label__3 i came here before a christmas party to get a blowout .  everyone was nice ,  and aveda salons are great for the little extras  ( ask for the mini facial !  )  .  i was not wowed by the girl that did my hair ,  but it did turn out nice and i got a lot of compliments .    my last salon i had to go to a few people before i found "the one" - you know the person you connect with and don ' t mind chatting with and does your hair great !  so i have high hopes for laura lee . 
__label__1 they make you buy the overdone roast beef that is left over before they will sell you the rare beef and if you complain they say "dont come back"
__label__5 recently moved to town and have been very unimpressed with the salami available at the local grocery store .  walked into this place looking for better salami and i found it !  not only did they have a few verity they also had hot sopressata which is great on sandwiches .  they guy behind the counter was super helpful .  everything looked so good that i ended up walking out of there with like 4 types of deli meat . 
__label__2 this is not really a good butcher shop the chicken is scrawny and the meat does not always look the best be careful on the meat that you chose it is not the freshest looking meat .  the only thing that i buy is chicken breast has a good price and the bacon .  they do not always clean the cheese slicer so ask for it to be cleaned . 
__label__4 this place reminds me of the meat shop i grew up going to .   true butcher shop .  filet is $21 . 99 a pound which is pretty much the going rate .   phenomenal quality filet .  .  . as in restaurant quality .   other stuff sold there ?   spices ,  seasonings ,  deli meat ,  cheese ,  pasta .   i have been searching for a replacement steak rub ,  and dare i say i found a great one here  ( szged brand )  .   yowza it is awesome .   the parking lot  ( i don ' t know if you can even call it a lot .  .  . it is more of a parking  ' strip '  )  is completely messed so i suggest you enter their parking strip with one hand on the wheel and one hand on the horn if you know what i mean .  .  . 
__label__4 my roommate brought back some tiffany ' s pizza today .  he was working on a job site out in that area ,  brought a huge sheet pizza home .  it was just sitting on the kitchen table ,  at cold ,  room temperature ,  so i tried some .  i have to say ,  it was good .  the crust was a little thick ,  sauce kind of sweet .  i was a little hungover and this did me some good .  i am very thankful and happy right now .  i am back in the bed typing away with a full stomach . 
__label__2 not very good pizza at all ,   the only reason i gave it two stars instead of one was it was so damn cheap .   but honestly i didn ' t like it at all . 
__label__1 i wouldn ' t recomment this place to my worst enemy .   completely lied to and misled on so many details .   practices were unsafe and even after they agreed with my complaints they refused to give even a portion of my money back .   i ' ve been a member at several gyms and used different personal trainers over the years ,  but these guys do not know how to run a business or treat people ! 
__label__5 euphoria is a great new gym on the west side near the airport .  very clean ,  offers classes that can ' t be found at other gyms and their equipment / machines are extremely high end .  the staff was extremely helpful . 
__label__4 i will qualify this by saying that s&r is a great market to have nearby if you understand their limitations .   we pretty much only shop here for apples and bananas ,  and maybe some other produce if we plan to use it the same day .   the inside of the store is pretty dirty ,  and they don ' t take credit cards .   i wouldn ' t buy anything from their deli .   i ' d say their quality of produce is about on par with what i expect from the wsm  ( with a few exceptions )  .   you can get great deals ,  but you need to use it quickly . 
__label__2 this place is connected with cadillac ranch which is more of a casual restaurant / bar place with a mechanical bull .  barroom is more of a club scene with the huge dance floor .  there are two bars on the dance floor ,  one when you walk in and one in the back so it ' s convenient .  the bartenders are nice and drinks are okay .  last time i was here ,  there were some many incompetent ones and i think my last visit has gotten a little better .  they actually hired someone that knows how to make drinks !    i visited this place several times before when nights were busier .  my most recent visit was on a friday night which i found kind of surprising that it wasn ' t busy at all .  the music was okay .  the dj played your top 40 hits ,  some old school ,  so it had a nice vibe .  the crowd for the night wasn ' t your typical 20 year-olds but actually a much older crowd .  to that ,  the crowd had a mix of older people who actually were dancing like the younger people which was hard to look at .  i was kind of disgusted and left the place . 
__label__3 somehow i got on the list to get in free here the opening night .  i am not sure if it normally requires a cover ,  but it did that night .  i would be completely annoyed to hear that it still requires a cover .  at this point ,  with the population and economy the way it is in cleveland ,  bars should just be happy anyone wants to come at all .  anyways ,  i suppose if you want to see a bunch of hambones and hooknasties in too tight of clothing that people were wearing on the coasts 2-3 years ago ,  this is the place for you .  if you don ' t want to have a seizure from flashing lights or pick up the h1n1 or other viruses* from gooey railings ,  then it isn ' t worth your time . 
__label__5 i love hole-in-the-wall-back-of-the-market places like these .  because for it to survive ,  it has to offer something more substantial than good setting / location / service - good food !  i ' ve never truly had filipino food ,  so i was happy to try what appeared to be a very authentic looking place .  how do i know it ' s authentic ?  i came for the saturday lunch buffet and i ' ve never had a buffet where it looked like all the dishes were homemade .  as if i went to someone house and all the asian grandmas were cooking in the kitchen .  and it had a decent amount of people - mostly filipinos eating in the restaurant .  another confirmation that it ' s legit .   i would love to return and order their desserts  ( the pictures of the halo halo look amazing !  )  and dishes off the menu .  this place definitely deserves more attention . 
__label__4 i ' ve gone to nipa hut three times now .  i ' m not particularly knowledgeable about filipino food ,  but i will say that this place delivers on high quality food nonetheless .  the restaurant itself is fairly small ,  lending to a fairly "homey" atmosphere that is very relaxed and comfortable .  the entrees stand alone don ' t offer much of variety ,  so i prefer to go during their saturday morning buffets .   the buffet itself is well worth the price .  tea is complimentary ,  and aside from that the buffet has a wide variety of meats ,  vegetables ,  seafood ,  and desserts .  i find it very admirable that nipa hut doesn ' t hold back on authenticity ,  opting to serve dinuguan and whole fish  ( with bones )  as part of their buffet options .  their spring rolls are very good ,  and taste homemade as opposed to store bought .  the various stews and stir fry dishes are also great ,  though i can ' t say i know much about their names or what ' s in the dishes .  the barbecue chicken ,  while simplistic ,  is deceptively good ,  having been smoked for very long periods of time . 
__label__5 oak tree is wonderful .  all of the staff are so friendly ,  welcoming ,  and love animals !  from the moment we walked in ,  i knew we were found the perfect vet  ( we are new to the area )  .  dr .  smith was so caring and explained everything in great detailed - our sweet dog was bitten by another pup ,  so he was treated and put on antibiotics and pain killers .  we will definitely return to oak tree in the future !  !  ! 
__label__5 my son goes there and he ' s pretty satisfied him everything he finds the guy is nice feel sad for him he looks very lonely anyways good place the prices
__label__1 seriously ,  is this how you want to jeopardize your plans by renting a car from an irresponsible rental car company ,  let them rent out the car you have paid for in advance ,  not provide you with another car instead ,  leave you on your own while there is no one to take the responsibility and help you out ?   1 )  the above scenario was the summary of what happened to me on sep 5 ,  2015 with hertz .  when i showed up at the location of reservation i was told that because they were "overbooked" they could not provide me with a car ,  regardless of the fact that i had paid for that car in advance .  whether this is a flaw on the part of corporate or the location branch ,  the fact that no one takes responsibility to provide me an alternative option is also worth noting .  they don ' t care if they have been paid for a car .   3 )  i was directed to call the 1-800 number by the location and ask if there is any car available at cleveland hopkins airport location  ( some 12 miles away )  to transfer my reservation and pickup the car there .   ( it was 12:00 pm on saturday ,  although their fault ,  the agent didn ' t offer to do that for me )  .   4 )  in my first attempt ,  the lady on 1-800 number hangs up on me when i ask whether it is true that i am entitled to the car i have paid for in advance .  the conversation started with me saying i wanted to pick up from the airport but return the car to the location where i had made my reservation in the first place .  i was willing to make the concession to pickup from the 12-miles-away airport but no-way if i had to return the car at the end of rental .  she says this is a possibility but the rate would be significantly higher  ( almost 10 times that of the original reservation )  if i preferred to return to a different location .  she treated me as if no mistake had been made on the part of hertz and i was just inquiring the rates for that day !  it was when i asked the question in response to which she hung up on me .   5 )  i call again with the request to talk to a supervisor .  well ,  there is none available to me !  i get transferred to an experienced agent instead .  he says i could have expected the location to call the airport and make arrangements to transfer the reservation on my behalf .  he doesn ' t do that for me ,  though .  he just transfers my call to the airport location .   6 )  i explain the situation to the lady at cleveland hopkins airport location .  she places a request to transfer the rental to their location but says i need to wait for the corporate to call me back with the result of the inquiry because it is beyond her control an the transfer needs to be approved at the corporate level .    7 )  i wait for an hour and no one calls me back .  i head back home ,  disappointed ,  and mad as my whole weekend plans were ruined .    8 )  by the time i am writing this review  ( 31 hours after the original reservation time )  i have received no calls from hertz .  hertz has not refunded me for the failed reservation either .   i would be an idiot to risk my plans and do business with hertz again ! 
__label__5 great place !  2 coworkers and i stopped in on our day off and everyone was super friendly .  my tattoo turned out great ,  john did an excellent job !  i will definitely be coming back when i am in town . 
__label__5 i had about 1 hour ' s worth of work done of script writing on my chest .  it turned out really well and my artist was matt ,  who i was told was one of their best handwriting guys .  also i have recommended for 4-5 of my friends to go there also and they loved it and got great work done as well .  very clean and new feel to the shop ,  it ' s an open concept and people who care about the finished product
__label__5 traditionally ,  i would avoid such a cholesterol-raising endeavor ,  but the other day the craving called ,  and who am i to deny it ?  exactly .  i casually drove up to the drive-thru and was greeted by a surprisingly delightful amount of enthusiasm that i had thought was generally reserved for finer dining establishments such as chipotle .    anyway ,  after efficiently taking my order and politely instructing me as to what one should do next in order to keep the transaction rolling smoothly ,  i was then called "dear" .  hand to jesus ,  i was now being spoken to with endearment .  for a brief moment i was filled with warmth and a longing for my mother ' s embrace .  .  .  .  so i pulled forward .    at the window ,  i was elated to finally meet the woman who had shown me such love so early on in the relationship .  her smile was authentic and her cheery demeanor emanated from within .  she also had wicked tight hair .  the joyful face-to-face conversation was above and beyond any that i had encountered in such situations of the past .  her co-worker ,  who was scooping up the piping-hot fries also chimed in with some pretty sweet one-liners .  i had died and gone to burger king heaven .    compliments were flying ,  and the fries were a frying ,  but it was time to move on for all of us ,  and although hard ,  i pulled away with what was truly a remarkable fast-food encounter and vowed to write a review .    all of us foodies pretend ,  that these little blights on our palates don ' t exist ,  but lets be real .  .  .  we all still occasionally visit  the king or the arches .  let us not hide in shame ,  but tell of our journeys and make the road less traveled better known .    10 jazz fingers to the fine ladies of severance center ' s bk .  .  .  they made it my way ! 
__label__5 mertie ' s hungarian strudel shop is an absolute must visit if you are in the area .  when you are a bakery that only makes one thing ,  you better be outstanding at it .  mertie ' s blows it out of the water .  the filling is delicious and the dough is incredibly flaky and delicate .  this shop is run by a little old lady who has been baking this delicious treat for decades ,  with help from her granddaughter .  worth the stop wherever you are . 
__label__5 if you love gyros then you must try gyro guys !  omg !  the food is fantastic and topped only by the friendly and made to order service and hospitality of the owner and staff !   ( clean clean clean dining rooms and bathrooms !  )  did i mention how fantastic the gyros are at the gyro guy restaurant ?  trust me ,  go there hungry ! 
__label__5 saw this place on yelp while running a work errand near old brooklyn .  i have a soft spot for gyros -- specifically ,  my belly -- so i had to investigate .    so glad i did ,  because i otherwise wouldn ' t have met the gyro guy .  and by that ,  i mean a toasted pita stacked with a generous portion of perfectly griddled gyro meat ,  juicy chicken breast ,  fresh cut fries ,  lettuce ,  tomato ,  onions ,  and a huge dollop of homemade tzatziki  ( asked for hot sauce on the side ,  too )  .    not sure what they supplier they use ,  but the gyro meat is more juicy and flavorful than what ' s served at most other joints .  friendly service ,  too .  definitely worth the haul down to old brooklyn . 
__label__4 went to the shop last night- got za to go ,  crisp ,  cheesy ,  and tasty .   i can ' t wait to return and check out the daily specials- monday bogo burrito ,  $2 taco tuesday .  coolest thing- sit down pac mac & gallaga . 
__label__5 have you ever eaten something so delicious that it completely altered your day ?  thats what happened today when we went to jibaro gourmet food truck .  my mouth literally waters when i think about it .  we went to beats and eats  ( highly recommend it ,  explained below )  .  our plan was to try a couple of trucks ,  starting w / jibaro .  however ,  after our tastebuds were tantalized ,  we had to try more !  !  we started with the tropical jerk chicken combo - a fantastic flavorful yet slightly sweet taste- served with beans and 5-spice rice  ( omg )  and a life-changing churro .  we ' re never had anything like it .  it was so fluffly and delicious encrusted with cinnamon sugar and filled with a delicious cream of some sort .  and i normally dont really like filling - but this was phenomenal .  we went back and got the garam masala shredded beef that was served on the beans and rice .  wowza !  it had the best flavor profile ever .  a little zing ,  a little sweet ,  a little citrus ,  mmmm .  it was a foodgasm for sure .  the owner is so nice and i think its so cool how they can turn out such delicious gourmet food when they literally do everything on the truck from prep to cooking to serving .  the world eats is a pretty accurate part of their name .  they take their inspirations from all over .  i dont know if anyone else could combine latin american and indian flavors into such a perfect marriage .  bravo !  i ' ll probably be back soon .  .  .  like today .  .  .  . 
__label__1 great / friendly service ,  but the veggie burrito is exceptionally bland with not much other than rice  ( some corn ,  beans ,  and a token amount of spinach )  .   was hoping for something more flavorful .   neither of us enjoyed it .   would not recommend it . 
__label__4 i have to say that this food is great .   i honestly did not think that i was going to find a single thing on the menu that i would like since i am not a fan of onions or peppers but these guys  ( and girl )  were awesome with accomodating me to the best of their ability .   they decided my best option was to go with the pulled pork with just a small amount of the beans and rice  ( so that i wouldn ' t spend all day picking out the onions )  .   they made it into a meal with a side ,  a desert and a drink for just 2 extra bucks  ( i love a great deal !  )  and after a short wait i was headed back to my office to try a whole new style of food .   as you can imagine ,  being my first time ,  i was excited and apprehensive all at the same time .   but having already spent my lunch $ on the bowl of food in front of me ,  i was left with little option but to dig in or go hungry .   i chose to dig in .   i can honestly say that i really liked the food- like a lot !   i went from a skeptic to a believer within 3 bites of the pulled pork mixed in with the rice .   i also had never had a plantain before so when i tried the fried plaintains  ( without dressing- apparently there was either onions or peppers in it since they omitted it from my tray )  i was all too  excited to find that they are delicious !   and the desert churro was super yummy- the perfect sweetness to top off the meal .     unfortuantely ,  although i truly enjoyed this entire meal  ( which shocked even me !  )  ,   i can only give it 4 stars since i just don ' t know that this could be a regular thing due to my food preferences .   however ,  what i had today was new and great and they definitely deserve at least 4 stars for getting me to try this new strangely yummy food ! 
__label__4 just say "hee ' -ba-roh" spices from around the world chimmichurri rocks  nice to see a food truck that expands culinary horizons .   all good with jibaro .   plantains ,  pineapple bread ,  pizza rolls ,  pinchos .  .  .   if you see this one ,  pull over .   carry on .  .  . 
__label__4 zoss is the boss !    i ' ve driven by zoss almost everyday for the last two years and have never tried it until now .  and i must say ,  i ' m disappointed in myself for waiting so long !    zoss is a small bakery located in a brick building right across from chase bank .  this bakery doesn ' t have any indoor or outdoor seating area ,  so be prepared to eat them pastries on-the-go or in the comfort of your home / office !  every item is fairly priced at around $2 ,  much cheaper than other bakeries in the area .  i picked the chocolate papillion and the nutty palmier .  both are a must-try !  !  the papillion was extremely soft and the bits of chocolate chip just sealed the deal .  the palmier was crispy ,  flaky and rich !    the service was superb !  the woman manning the front was extremely patient ,  friendly ,  and helpful .  the service along with the delicious pastries make me want to stop by every . single . day : ) 
__label__5 i was always surprised that so few people knew about zoss !  it is the best bakery in cleveland ,  and easily the best bakery i ' ve ever tried .   my family frequented zoss for years when we were still in cleveland and i can honestly say i never tried something that wasn ' t delicious .   the fruit  filled croissants and appel strudel are spot on amazing ! 
__label__5 believe the hype .  .  . zoss bakes and sells the best chocolate dipped coconut macaroon i have ever tasted .   i thought bon bon made the best ones until i tried the one from zoss .   the toasted coconut on top makes it .   very small place .   you practically close the door behind you and you are standing in front of the bakery case .   a grab n go bakery . 
__label__5 this is a wonderful little gem of a bakery tucked away atop cedar hill .   everything is baked fresh in the morning ,   and i haven ' t tried anything that i didn ' t like .  today i had a walnut palmer .  it was so buttery ,  flaky ,   and flavorful .   highly recommended . 
__label__5 very clean friendly and good food  .  my order is always on time and fresh  .  i love the rewards program and special offers  . 
__label__5 i always order papa john ' s i think is pretty decent and has good flavors ,  its very convenient thats its only 200 feet from my house .   overall i like it alot
__label__5 nothing is really different about this sams club compared to any other location i ' ve been to on the east coast .   they have awesome deals in bulk and great prices on tires !   i ' ve never bought tires from here but i ' ve heard nothing but good things from my friend that has purchased tires from here .   i honestly can say that every time i come here i have to take a rotisserie chicken home !  they are so big ,  juicy ,  and tender ,  how can anyone just turn away from these beauties !  plus it gives me an excuse why i didn ' t cook tonight !   they also have awesome deals on leggings for you ladies that love staying comfortable !   i ' d definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves grocery shopping in bulk and saving big ! 
__label__3 good cheap place to play golf on the east side of cleveland .   i would be very careful leaving your clubs outside the clubhouse .   i have heard multiple stories about clubs and even full sets of irons being picked up by some of the people that hang around there .   keep a watchful eye . 
__label__2 not good italian food ,  not very good food overall ,   and way too expensive for what you get .     only go because of the outdoor seating  ( and ignore that the food isn ' t that great )  .   it ' s very enjoyable to sit in little italy and enjoy the music .     the best thing about la dolce vida is the bread ,  and i ' m rather sure they get it from presti ' s . 
__label__4 great american / bar food .  this is located in the valley and it ' s pretty good .  they have a pretty poplar sports bar too ,  where lots of people watch the browns or the indians in the summer .  the service is excellenet and the place is kept up nicely ! 
__label__3 stopped by here for some booze after dinner at tommy ' s and it didn ' t disappoint .   there is quite a good beer selection ,  especially in bottles .   i had a couple local beers which were decent ,  though not spectacular .   i didn ' t try any food ,  but it all looked to be standard fried everything pub food ,  so i doubt i was really missing too much .   other than that it ' s really just an average bar .  .  .  worthy of stopping in ,  but not a place you ' d go out of your way for .   i did like the multiple tvs above the bar with multiple sporting events on . 
__label__3 so many memories here at the wink !   here are some things that i like about this place:  - they show michigan games ,  and you can always count on seeing at least one other fan here on football saturdays wearing maize and blue - they have $0 . 40 wing nights on mondays and tuesdays !  bf and i tried eating a total of 35 b / c we thought they would be small .  .  .  wrong .  we couldn ' t do it .  - they have a really great selection of draught beverages and beer from all over the world .  this was the first place i tried lambic .  - it ' s always a lively place where a lot of young professionals come to hang out after work !  - classic ,  unpretentious pub .  good service ,  except when the waitresses wear osu jerseys . 
__label__4 had about 30 minutes to pop in before sound check down the street ,  and i ' m glad i did !   great local beers on tap ,  i forget what local ipa i tried ,  and i really enjoyed my jerk chicken sandwich .   fries were crispy ,  bartenders were attentive ,  football was on tv .   it was the perfect getaway from tourlife for just a few minutes .  thanks winking lizard ,  next time i ' m in town i ' m coming back ! 
__label__5 the name says it all .  .  so delicious ,  nourishing ,  and satisfying while feeling clean .  this is one of those places that will convince you that vegan does not mean flavorless .    the lunch special is a huge portion  ( 2 meals for me ,  tastes great reheated )  ,  and is usually some sort of stew ,  brown rice ,  steamed kale and cauliflower ,  and a corn muffin .   regarding the service-- if you ' re in a rush ,  opt for the daily special; the stew is already prepared .  anything else is typically made to order ,  so if you ' re pressed for time ,  save it for another day .  but ,  all of that time and love definitely goes into the food .  .  .  it ' s so good . 
__label__1 the first day they opened i went over to check them out .  they did not have a menu available and only had two options to choose from ,  a $6 option and a $12 option .  i didn ' t know what either of the two were but i like to try new things ,  so i picked the $6 one .  once i got my food i was told they did not accept credit cards yet .  .  .  big disappointment .  i asked the lady what it came to after tax and she said just $12 .  i walked away kind of in shock wondering how that got messed up ?  i looked in my bag and there was a plastic container about 9in .  x 9in .  and it had about 2 cups of what looked like salsa ,  and a little pinch of lettuce and hummus .  i thought this was kind of .  .  .  .  .  .  expensive .  .  .  .  and showed multiple people in the marketplace and at my job .  i did not even find it that satisfying .  i never went back and i did not intend to pay for what little food i received .  i was highly disappointed with what i got .  a few weeks later the guy who works at the counter actually came into my job and asked me to pay him .  talk about bad business ,  right ?  !  i was very unhappy .  i gave him the $2 cash that i had on me and told him that is all i think it was worth .  now every time i walk by he stares at me or makes weird gestures to whoever i am with while looking at me  ( shaking his head ,  his finger ,  ect .  .  )  definitely not a pleasant environment for me ,  but it may be different for you now that they have been open for a few months ?  good luck ! 
__label__4 after yelping for places we ' ve never eaten at downtown ,  we settled upon pure and supreme ,  based on the wealth of good reviews .   and we were not disappointed !  located in the euclid arcade ,  this little restaurants has delicious home cooked food .  and it ' s vegan too !   we ordered the special of the day- for ten bucks ,  we got a plantain tomato stew ,  curry cauliflower ,  mac n cheese ,  and collard greens .  all of it was delicious- i especially liked the sweetness and tangy-ness of the plantain tomato stew .  it even came with this homemade corn muffin which was moist ,  not too oily ,  and just good .   we also got a side of hummus  ( with warm whole grain pita )  and a salad with some homemade dressing too .   all in all ,  if you ' re around the euclid arcade ,  this place is definitely worth trying out .  they take a little while to prepare the food ,  but it has that homemade taste to it ,  which makes it all worth it . 
__label__4 loved this museum ,  but like most ,  heavily focused on european culture .  wish the modern and middle eastern sections were bigger . 
__label__5 wow ,  the renovations were wonderfully done !   we spent 4 hours touring around and there was still more to see .   we went for the pompeii exhibit and also to see the nice collection of contemporary art .     we were so impressed ,  we became members .   i look forward to returning on another sunday to take in the exhibits and have brunch in the new restaurant  ( provenance )  .   my only complaint:  they need to redesign the cafe to make it easier for people to order and pay for their meals .   their current design is very inefficient and confusing .   ( but on the plus side ,  there is a nice variety of drinks ,  nibbles ,  and entrees .  )   oh ,  and they really need better signage in the university circle area . 
__label__5 boy am i happy that cleveland museum of art is in cleveland !   ( wait ,  what ?  )  cma is one of the very few museums in the world that is free to the public due to its amazing sponsorships  ( can they get what what !  )  .  the variety of different cultures you see in each room ,  on both floors is quite impressive .  nothing looks or screams free about it  ( which is usually not the case )  .  whether you care to read all painting descriptions or to just admire each stroke of the painters art-its the best place to go for life to escape you .  it ' s peaceful and soothing ,  yet makes you really think when you come across an amazing painting  ( which is quite often in this museum )  .    cleveland museum also does its fair share of promoting great events during the week nights and weekends .  one of my favorites are the monthly mix events where they focus on a certain genre of music or a certain type of style they want newcomers to be prepared to upon arriving .  my favorite is in the summer when they have it in the back in the garden .  loud music ,  drinks ,  meeting new people ,  summer nights - what more can you ask for ? 
__label__5 after living in cleveland for 15 months i decided to visit the newly renovated cleveland museum of art and i was totally blown away .    first of all it is always free !  parking is covered and you can pay at the time of exit or at the kiosks in the museum .  there is free coat check in  ( very fancy coat racks too )  .  as soon as i entered the atrium took my breath away .  it was a cloudy and snowy day  ( typical cleveland )  but inside was so beautiful and warm .  kids were excited and playing near plants  (  in the middle of the winter )  .  they have a unique artlens project which is an ipad app .  this app is amazing !  you can place your ipad on the pod and select what you want to see today from the wall ,  it will create a customized tour for you  .    once you are tired of walking in the museum ,  sit down for some cocktail or eat and very nice modern cafeteria .  you can also visit the museum shop and buy some memorabilia .  museum shop is nice and reasonably priced . 
__label__5 pleasantly surprised .  cleveland ,  you surprise me at times .   having spent a month exploring the museums in dc  ( smithsonian museum of contemporary art !  )  ,  as well as having frequented the moma and the art institute of chicago .  .  .  .  i wondered ,  could this random art museum in the middle of case ' s campus live up to its hype ?   and yes ,  it did .    minus the tour ladies who thought my parents and i were foreigners and tried handing us brochures in japanese  ( one of them actually pointed to us and said ,  "here ,  maybe this will help ! " while holding the brochure )  ,  and kept telling us about the asian art exhibit  ( good grief ,  stop already !  )  ,  this museum was great .   sure ,  it ' s not as big as most art museums .  but honestly ,  i liked its size .  i always hate weaving in and out of people in museums like the smithsonian ,  b / c it ' s always a madhouse- kids screaming ,  ppl be annoying and not knowing how to look at art ,  etc etc ,  but in the cma ,  you can actually just walk around and look at the art- without having to go through some strategic path to get to the actual piece of art .   contemporary ,  french ,  medieval ,  they got it all .  i was pleasantly surprised to see degas ,  monet ,  picasso ,  georgia o ' keefe ,  and rodin sculptures around the museum .  i definitely did a double take with a - "wha ?  ?  ?  ?  this is in cleveland ?  !  ! " : )    i want to go back for more of their exhibits .  i wonder how much a membership would cost .  .  .  .  ?   yay for a cool cultural place of cleveland .  .  .  : ) 
__label__5 i haven ' t been here since the renovations were finished .  the atrium is so gorgeous !  so much natural light .  i also absolutely love how the old original art building is part of the atrium also .   i went straight to the modern art section .  i really enjoyed the selection .  my only issue would be that they don ' t allow any photos in the modern art section .   i walked the entire second floor in about 2 hours .  i didn ' t spend too much time in certain sections ,  so you could definitely spend the whole day .    the cafe looked super clean and attractive .  next time i ' m there i ' ll definitely have lunch . 
__label__5 the cleveland museum of art is yet another one of this city ' s amazing gems !  i was invited to a special president ' s alumni listening tour ,  hosted by kent state university which was held here .   we had a wonderful mediterranean themed dinner in the beautiful atrium .  we feasted on lamb ,  hummas ,  pita bread ,  grilled chicken ,  crab cakes ,  grilled fish ,  spinach ,  a fresh fruit platter ,  pine nuts ,  a variety of beer ,  wines ,  sodas ,  designer water ,  and goat cheese .   the atrium itself ,  was a work of art !  i loved all the beautiful plants ,  which looked like a garden in a lovely park .  the staff was very attentive and very professional .  i will definitely comeback another day ,  to view all of the world class art that they have on display . 
__label__5 this is an update . i returned to this excellent art museum the following day . i concentrated  on its fine 20th century european paintings , including claude monet ' s"waterlilies" , andre derain ' s"houses of parliamemt" , gabrielle munter ' s"future" . max beckmann ' s"perseus last  duty" , rene magritte ' s"secret life" , among others .  i also appreciated its collection of fine american paintings , including awesome paintings by john rogers cox ( "grey and gold" )  , charles scheeler ( "church street el . new york city" )  , mark tansey ( "soft borders" ) childe hassam ( "fifth avenue , new york city" )  ,  rockwell kent ( "maine coast" ) and alex katz ( "impala" )  , among others . there was a splendid painting by mozambiquan painter , malangatana ngnwenya ( "fountain of blood" )  . their collection of chinese art was very comprehensive and splendid , including excellent depictions of guanyin ( sculpture ) from the jin , yuan , and tang dynasties . their collection of ancient middle eastern art was also tip top , including artifacts from iraq ( saluting protective spirit , neo assyrian nimrud made of gypsum ) iran ( fragment of mall decoration from palace of xerxes made of limestone ) and syria . this art museum is free , but your support and donations help it to maintain its very high standards . 
__label__5 currently undergoing a huge renovation ,  so i am hoping the displays will be even more impressive when finished .   i have seen larger variety at other art museums but the quality is pretty high here .   there is plenty of work by popular impressionists .   again ,  i hope the expansion will help bring more variety of different art forms .   i saw the rembrandt exhibit which was great ,  as i am a fan .   and the fee for the special exhibit was not painful ,  as the general admission is free !   i ' m proud of the art culture in my home town and i love all of the art classes that were in process while i was there . 
__label__5 i was in cleveland for work and stopped by when i had a few hours before my flight out ,  i love art museums and was very impressed here .   i headed straight for the post-impressionist section and was pleasantly surprised to see that they also had many well-known works  ( large monet water lilles )  .   the galleries are arranged very well ,  and make a beautiful use of the space and natural light .     the atrium between the two buildings is absolutely gorgeous ,  it would be a wonderful venue for a party .   i had lunch at the cafe ,  my salad was great and i was very happy that i chose this place to spend a few hours .   i was there on a friday afternoon and it was not very crowded .   there is a donation box but admission is technically free . 
__label__5 i ' m glad i finally checked out this museum .     first of all ,  it ' s free !   they have a little of every style of fine art - impressionism ,  modern art ,  egyptian ,  african art ,  and photography to name a few .   i was impressed that they had a few picasso ,  monet ,  van gogh and matisse paintings plus more from many greats !    on my visit ,  they had a photography exhibit of ohio retail affected by the current economy that i enjoyed .   it was quite interesting .  the photographer ' s name is brian ulrich .   the cleveland museum of art is a must see if you ' re in cleveland and enjoy art . 
__label__5 gotta throw in my 5 stars review for the cleveland museum of art .  great museum free !  parking is awkward .  if you are from out of town - getting there will be weird depending on where you are coming from - hang in there - just keep driving around and follow your gut and your gps . 
__label__5 what a gem !  free admission  ( although parking starts at $8 for non-members )  .  so many collections and i ' ve loved taking my elementary and preschool age kids to introduce them to art and reinforce different things they learn about at school . 
__label__3 has this re-opened ?  ?  ?  ?   how does a major art museum actually close its doors for the better part of 5 years and plan to survive ?   how does this museum expect to be taken seriously ?   the collection is awesome .   i grew up with my parents taking our family here on sunday afternoons .   i just don ' t comprehend how this place is managed other than very poorly . 
__label__5 fantastic museum that rivals other world class institutions .  museum is always free admission ,  small fee for special exhibitions .  their permanent collection is vast and wonderful ,  covering most regions of the world throughout most of history .  friendly staff ,  clean ,  and they have a higher end cafe of you ' re hungry .  worth a visit ,  great free educational activity ! 
__label__3 it is free to visit this museum ,  which is nice .  i took a walk inside after visiting the cleveland botanical garden ,  which is right across the street .  the art museum is very large in terms of building size ,  and the exhibits are nicely organized in smaller areas .  for myself ,  i didn ' t find many of the exhibits very interesting .  not many interesting things to photograph either if you are interested in doing that . 
__label__5 the cleveland museum of art has an impressive collection with some world-class pieces of art .   in addition to the main rooms ,  they ' ve installed other artworks in odd spaces of the museum which enhances the whole aesthetic experience .   special exhibitions are aesthetically and intellectually engaging .   it ' s architecturally stunning;  with the new addition ,  they built a lush ,  warm ,  beautiful in-between space ,  so it ' s like a little paradise you can rest in between excursions to the galleries .   if i lived in cleveland ,  i ' d want to be here all the time .   on top of all this ,  admission is free .   totally free .   permanent collection or special exhibitions ,  it ' s all free .   any city would be fortunate to have a public institution like the cleveland museum of art . 
__label__5 the people are amazing here .  tiara cuts my hair better than anyone -ever .  my son and i also got great shaves from the guys .  service is phenomenal .  i enjoy the staff and the quality of their work .    remember to tip your set server !  !  !  ! 
__label__5 i ' m a dude .   i hate haircuts .   i ' ve never gone to the same haircut place twice .     that all changed with la barberia express .    i went there last month and got a great haircut-- they listened ,  they knew what they were doing ,  and their prices were very reasonable .   they were friendly and recommended things ,  but didn ' t push products or go for the hard sell .     i walked in as a shaggy mess and walked out a happy man .   if you need a haircut ,  this is the place to go .   ask for the guy with the spider web tattoo on his elbow   ( the self-proclaimed  ' lebron '  of hairstyling )  .   i promise you won ' t regret it ! 
__label__1 here to start with my "experience" at this salon .  okay ,  deep breath ,  here goes:  yelped this place ,  my stylist was leah ,  she seemed pretty nice and was the first salon to have a same day opening--should ' ve known there .  i had seriously overprocessed hair and needed a fresh start ,  and told her i wanted to chop about 7 in off ,  and i wanted a pseudo asymmetrical bob ,  longer in front ,  shorter in back ,  and bangs .  i also wanted a dye ,  dark brown with some bright red chunks in front .  i even specified the type of dye-prevana ,  because my old stylist back home used it and it was uber bright and lasted .   she assured me she could get the same result without lightening and with revlon .  she was wrong .  she charged me an extra $35 for seriously ,  a few strands  ( and it washed out after 1 wash )  .  oh and she double booked ,  so i got to sit there for an hour while my dye worked its way  ( did i mention they have no dryers ?  !  )  anyways ,  the cut itself wasn ' t bad ,  and i was originally pretty happy .  it took a few hours ,  which reminds me-theres 2-hour max metered parking .  i asked a few times about getting up to go put more money in ,  and she assured me ,  repeatedly ,  that it would be fine ,  that its only until 4  ( she was wrong again )  .    i paid $130 for my hair ,  with tip ,  got to my car and realized lo and behold ,  i had a parking ticket . which brings the cost to $160 .   don ' t lie to me ,  i wouldve had no problem putting in more change !  !  i specifically asked because i didnt want a ticket ,  ahh !  anyways .  then i get in the car and look at my hair again ,  and realize there was very little of the red highlights ,  and it wasnt bright ,  and it was uneven .  so was my hair .  i called her two days later  ( i had finals or i wouldve sooner )  and told her everything ,  and that i wanted her to fix my hair .  rescheduled for my next day off ,  yay ,  waste of another afternoon ,  plus ,  i live in amherst ,  and it was yet another 40 min drive ive get to make .  i was really not happy .    so i go back: visit #2 .  she got the prevana ,  bleached the chunks and then used the red dye .  she told me it would fade quickly .  .  . either she doesn ' t have the color extender my old stylist did ,  or just decided f-me ,  i wouldnt get any .  she offered to cut it a bit so the red would show through more ,  i accepted .  it looked cool ,  until i realized it was only on one side !  !  !  i told her to please even it on both sides ,  so she snipped like ,  one strand on the left side ,  and then said "all done" .  and walked away to another customer .    okay ,  ridiculously long ,  i know .  my apologies .  however ,  i had to explain the story .  basically ,  i was overcharged ,  had to go back so she could fix my hair ,  and she messed it up even more ,  and was kind of rude .  i now have two totally different cuts on the left and right side of my head .   oh ,  and she got me a parking ticket .  i could not be more upset and disappointed in a stylist ,  and i ' ve had a few really bad ones .  the fact that i now have to either let my hair grow a bit before getting it cut the way i wanted it ,  or go to someone else and get it even shorter ,  but either way have to spend more money because this woman didn ' t do it correctly ,  is absolute b . s .  i wouldn ' t go here for her ,  you will regret it .  i will never go near her again .  if i could ,  i would give negative stars . 
__label__5 i moved into a new home and the prior owners left a mess .   i was looking for someone with immediate availability .   cardinal maids didn ' t have it but called me back and worked me into an earlier slot .  i appreciated that and they got my business .     the two ladies that came were great .   not only were they professional and personable but did a great job maneuvering around the other work being done on the house that day .   i set up regular cleaning because of sick a positive experience .    even though i just moved here ,   their pricing was competitive to the other companies i called and payment is all online .   super convenient ! 
__label__5 i found cardinal maids using yelp so it ' s only fair i leave a review !  all other reviewers were spot on .  this is an amazing business and service .  when i tried to book my cleaning online my credit card wouldn ' t work ,  even though it is valid and had plenty of room on it .  i called their phone number and they were able to get my card charged no problem .    tara and her sister showed up on time and did an amazing job .  for background ,  i am moving into a new place and the previous tenants did a horrible job with move out cleaning and my landlord did not have a professional cleaner come in .  there was no way i ' d have time to do it all myself .  there was cat hair everywhere--really ,  it was a disgusting amount of cat hair in my opinion--and i have allergies .  they handled it and got probably 90% of the cat hair  ( and smell )  out of my new place .  i did the move in deep clean and it was sparkling and smelled great .  this included cleaning cabinets ,  the baseboards ,  wiping all the doors and some spots on the walls ,  etc .  and they were fast !  in and out in like 2 . 5 hours i think .  and definitely sweet ladies to talk to as well !    i will definitely be using you guys again in the future once i ' m situated !  i know come fall i ' m going to have a packed schedule and i ' m going to have someone else clean my house to save some time .  it ' ll definitely be cardinal maids ,  hands down and i ' ll recommend to all my friends too ! 
__label__5 i love having cardinal maids come to my home every month .  terah and emily are personal ,  prompt & thorough .  i am able to now spend my limited free time on other things instead of staying home to clean on the weekends ! 
__label__1 worst building ever  .  . i will post few of my experience so far in this apt  1- i live in 6th floor  ,  today no elevator since morning  ,  where is the maintenance team  !  !  !  wow   2- three times so far  ,  no water from 9am to 12 pm  ,  in the west building   3- many times i had issues with my heart  ,  and they come next day to fix it  .  . imagine the cold cleveland   4- the laundry service is a joke  .  . i left my suite  ,  with my cc info in the lounge - supposed to be picked on monday  .  . my stuff stayed in the lounge till tuesday evening  .  .  . and when i called the laundry on friday to ask about my stuff  ,  they don ' t have it  !  !  !  then i called the office  ,  they answered " we have couple of bags here  ,  let us check " wow  .  . they found it   5 - vomitus stayed in the west building apt for whole day  .  .  . see the pic on yelp   6- they charged me for extra set of keys 75 dollars  .  . seriously  .  .  .  what if i live with spouse here and i needed two keys  .  .   the management needs to work on better services  ,  more community activists and take the customer service seriously  .  . bad experience
__label__4 been going here for quite sometime ,  although the service in lacking at times .  the food is very good ,  for bar food ,  on sunday and mondays they have a strip steak special that is excellent .  and reasonably priced . 
__label__4 so ,  i like this place .  .  .  . good talent and not a bad venue .  poor setup ,  bad placement in the restaurant and absolutely no signage as to where to go for the comedy club .  food is wayyyy overpriced and their alcohol selection is sub par .  service is .  .  .  .  . just ok . 
__label__4 love nick ,  been with him for twelve years .  a true professional .  the staff here is polite and friendly .  never any issues helping book appointments  . 
__label__1 my first experience really was terrible they put me in a bed that was one of the first ones ever made when they had new beds which is when i asked for and when i confronted them and all they could do is say they were sorry
__label__2 well ,  i sure feel like i just took some money out of my wallet and lit it on fire .   the quesadilla appetizer was decent  ( though a waste of duck confit )  ,  but it all went downhill from there .   the chicken pot pie entree was undersized ,  bland ,  and worth perhaps half of the $16 asking price .  my wife ' s ribeye special ,  ordered medium ,  arrived well done in most parts and was coated with a foul-tasting char .  also offensively priced at $30 .    the only saving graces were the excellent beer selection and the pleasant  ( though somewhat awkward )  service from our waiter and hostess .  the restaurant itself ,  housed inside a repurposed old movie theatre ,  is a great idea that deserves better food to go with it .    it ' s a shame that the food is so weak ,  because the east side needs more strong restaurants .  i hope that fracas can work out its issues .   perhaps i was asking for trouble going to a restaurant marketed via groupon .   despite the discount ,  still paid a sum that could have gotten me a stellar meal at greenhouse tavern . 
__label__3 the quesadilla appetizer was very good .  the pumpkin bisque had good texture but was a bit on the bland side ,  or needed a touch more salt .  the gnocchi main course was delicious .  .  . just the right amount of spice and lots of mushrooms .  it was very rich and i couldn ' t finish it all .  my companions had the meatloaf and the chicken pot pie .  the meatloaf was ok but not as good as the gnocchi .  the pot pie needed something to give it more flavor .    the wait staff tried hard but seemed inexperienced .  the space was comfortable ,  with the high ceiling .  somehow it felt like a 1920s speakeasy .  overall ,  i didn ' t like it as much as i wanted to .  we ' ll give them another try ,  to see if it was just part of working the kinks out of a new establishment . 
__label__5 i would like to thank the staff of fracas for a wonderful evening .  they provided a wonderful dining experience for my wife ,  friends and i .  to our  waiter ,  will ,  who provided wonderful service .  the sommelier ,  aaron vanderlin ,  who provided great insight on the wine and spirits we enjoyed .    and not to leave out the chef phil romano on preparing the most wonderful meal i have had the opportunity to enjoy .  i had the porcini crusted black angus strip with chive gratin ,  asparagus and heirloom tomato jam and my wife had the ohio city black pepper gnocchi with wild mushrooms ,  english peas ,  leeks ,  and grape tomatoes in a smoked gouda alfredo .  each meal was fabulously prepared with not only the taste of the food being paramount but the presentation of the food as well .  i had the opportunity to speak with the sommelier during my dining experience and was well educated on my choices of wine or spirits to pair with each of our meals .  this is a first class restaurant that i will be more than willing to drive and hour back to for a great meal and good company .  thank you again and look forward to seeing all of you again .     eric berkheimer
__label__2 other than being located right next to the theater ,  there wasn ' t much i enjoyed about my experience here .   well ,  i guess my peroni was cold .    the food was mediocre at best and the service ,  while prompt ,  was anything but friendly .    for the price there are better options within striking distance of playhouse square . 
__label__4 so beautiful !  !  !  i like to grab a starbucks and head to the hyatt to read email and text .  .  .  the cool thing is just about everyone walking around is from out of town so i take it upon myself to answer questions or pleasantly smile at anyone that may wander my way .  .  .  isn ' t that was a true clevelander would do ?  ?  ?  i do .  .  .  . 
__label__4 this place is absolutely cool and a treasure for sure ,  the elevators are tiny and theres a bit of navigating to find your room ,  but thats to be expected from a historical building ,  a key is required to access the upper decks .   i requested a fridge and it came right away ,  my tmobile service acts quite strange ,  and theres a weird earth quake like sensation every so often that could be annoying but its mild enough to tolerate .  im looking forward to seeing if the spa and chocolate bar in the arcade boost the property value of our stay ! 
__label__3 i thought i did well by getting a last minute $199 rate until i see everyone getting rooms for $60 !  oh well .   it was the middle of the work week and i needed a place close to my meeting downtown and this was the cheapest option i could find .   i agree with everyone who says this hotel is a bit weird ,  but weird in a cool way .   the cool sounding "arcade" is a bunch of mismatched shops  ( us post office ?  )  and mall-like restaurants that is pretty much dead except for the lunch-rush hour-- charley ' s cheesesteaks ,  a sandwich shop ,  the token greasy spoon chinese ,  etc .   i booked a king room but got a double .   nothing could be done ,  said the girl at the front desk ,  except an "upgrade" that would cost me more money .   forget that !   the wireless internet was "complimentary" because i have a hyatt gold passport .   doesn ' t sound complimentary to me ,  but it worked just fine .   the interior of this place seems a bit dated but not warn down .   the furniture ,  bed and pillows were comfortable .   the gym was pretty well outfitted .   my real complaint-- and it is not insignificant-- is that the walls are apparently paper thin .   the misfortune of this epiphany came at 3am when some revelers arrived home next door and were not being extremely loud yet it was as if they were in my room .   that sucks whether you are staying here for work or not .   i was shocked the tv was not a flatscreen .  it did the job ,  but i cannot remember the time i had an old tube tv in a hotel ,  especially one that bills itself as a business / decently upscale hotel .   finally ,  one neat thing for those who have been to milan-- you will notice the glass canopy spans the arcade is modeled after the one there .   here ,  it would be a lot cooler to look at if the tacky hyatt flags were not hung prominently in the way . 
__label__2 having grown up in northern ohio ,  my first visit to the cleveland arcade itself is a dim memory from early youth .  i moved away from the area some 45 years ago .  still ,  from time to time over all the years ,  my family has visited the arcade and stayed at the arcade hotels - since 2001 being the hyatt regency .  for that time the hotel has also been the base for  ( at the least )  a yearly "pilgrimage" my wife and i have made from southern or central ohio to cleveland .  during these trip we always enjoy a night at the beautiful severance hall to hear the famed cleveland symphony .  a day or two is spent traveling around town to various favorite spots such as; the west side market ,  tremont neighborhood ,  willoughby shops ,  r&r hall of fame; micro brews ,  and more .  usually one major highlight of the 2-3 day mini-vacation was our stay at the arcade hotel - most lately the hyatt regency .  i am sorry to say that in the future we will be giving strong consideration to finding new digs for future trips .    at the outset i will admit that a portion of the hyatt is reported to be under renovation ,  although we observed no outward sign of that except for rooms on a couple floors being unavailable .  i also note that we stayed at the hotel midweek .  still ,  the hyatt ,  in fact the entire arcade ,  imparted a feeling not unlike a ghost town might .  the arcade is now devoid of the shops that used to add a certain ,  special feel to the edifice ,  save the post office and a few fast food places in the food court .  a bellman told us a new owner had evicted the previous tenants .  no one seemed to know what was next for the arcade in that regard .  the gorgeous romanesque revival building itself appears to be in good shape and still glistens ,  even if in an eerily quiet manner .  the hyatt; well ,  i can ' t say it has fared so well .  if there is a renovation underway it is late in coming and definitely has not touched the room we stayed in .  if i could post a few pictures i would offer the worn ,  tattered ,  old chair; the rusty bathroom fixtures in the postage stamp bathroom ,  a bathroom with virtually no ventilation; the tv which ,  although fairly new ,  had not been adjusted properly and was all but impossible to see in low light; the threadbare carpeting near the bathroom entry; and ,  well that ' s probably enough .  at this point ,  in the interest of giving you the entire picture ,    i will further admit that we did take advantage of a special seniors '  rate - recently having joined that group - and wonder just a bit if our room reflected hyatt ' s disdain for  the small savings that the "special" rate offers .  in the past ,  pre-retirement ,  we always spent extra to stay on the arcade or when the entire family was along ,  in the suites .  maybe we are relegated to buying the cheap seats now .   the valet service ,  run by a third party ,  is probably the best part of the stay now .  the location is great ,  not too close to that darned casino ,  but close enough to the square to get to the restaurants there easily .    upon checkout i purposefully returned the room cards to the front desk just to see if i was met with the usual "we hope enjoyed your stay . " i do allow to have been planning to suggest that the room might be polished up a bit at the least .  there were two desk persons and a bellman standing at the desk who acted rather indifferent and offered not so much as a thank-you ?  !   .   .   .  yes ,  we had tipped generously - and yes ,  i did interrupt their private conversation by walking up to the counter; but there were no other patrons in the lobby at the time .  hence ,  given their apparent lack of interest i determined to rather hold my peace and offer my thoughts in this forum .    perhaps ,  if there is a renovation at the hyatt ,  and the new building owner brings back the small shops ,  or some fitting "face" of the arcade ,  it can return to its former level of quality and interest .  we would love to continue the tradition and stay there yet again .  in the meantime ,  we ' d suggest giving some thought toward skipping the hyatt regency cleveland . 
__label__1 i ' ve been wanting to check this place out since it was supposed to be the  ' it '  hotel of the moment in cleveland .  so while my parents '  house was getting painted during my visit here ,  i decided to stay here for a night .    upon arriving ,  there was no one to valet park your car even though it is $30 per night to park overnight .  also missing was the bell hop .  the lobby is located on the first floor so you basically have to carry all your stuff yourself up to check-in counter .    even there ,  i have not noticed anyone greeting guests .  yes it is pretty inside with glass dome ceiling but 80% of stores were empty .  there were hardly anyone inside .   the room was old and didn ' t even come with complimentary water .   the only thing good about this place is proximity to local attractions like terminal tower .  this is not definitely worth the money and i won ' t stay here again . 
__label__2 if i wasn ' t trying to get hyatt reward points ,  there is no way i would ever stay here .  it ' s in an historic building ,  but the amenities are truly subpar for a hyatt ,  especially a *hyatt regency* .  staff was friendly ,  but layout was poor and the rooms were very outdated .  furniture and decor looked worn and like they hadn ' t been upgraded since 2005 .  room was clean and bed was comfortable ,  but i expect so much more from a hyatt .  i did like the convenience of being next to great restaurants and bars ,  but i recommend staying at the brand new hilton down the street .  *that* is what i expect a hyatt to be like  ( beautiful new spaces ,  excellent dining ,  pool ,  etc )  . 
__label__1 we went to a wedding at the hyatt regency at the arcade and valeted our car .  while we were enjoying ourselves at the reception ,  the valet they subcontract  ( standard parking )  left our lights on ,  then jumped our battery with the cables backwards and caused damage to the car .  they gave us the runaround ,  did not return calls ,  and are refusing to pay .  while we had a nice time at the wedding  ( before we realized the damage the valet had done )  ,  we will never return . 
__label__4 this place was awesome .   my fiance found it on the internet .   we had friends in town from chicago and decided to go .   the food was amazing !  !  !  !   the price was just right .   it was one of the top three meals i have ever had in cleveland ! 
__label__4 be warned: the cleveland grill is easy to miss as you drive down w117th .  to be honest ,  it the type of drive where you would expect to find a stylish ,  romantic restaraunt that i would recommend to out of town friends .  perhaps that is why i do recommend it .  it is unique and unpretentious at the same time .  the food  ( mediterranean themed )  is tasty and well-priced .  you will love the selection and variety the menu offers .  you feel like you are getting a bargain and have discovered a diamond in the rough when you leave the cleveland grill .  .  .  . check it out if you haven ' t .  it is easily accessible from i-90 and i-71 ,  as well as sides of town . 
__label__4 first of all ,  i am a huge boston chicken fan  ( yes boston chicken that was the original name )  and because i am a creature of habit ,  i tend to stick with what i know and after you visit an establishment many times it becomes not so much about the food ( you already know you like it or you wouldnt keep going back )  it becomes about the whole package .  the service here is outstanding !  on my most recent visit i was overwhelmed by all the fresh choices i had for my sides .  so instead of just the three large sides that comes with the meal .  .  . this young girl bent over backwards to please me and let me get several smaller size sides so that i wouldnt leave un-satisified .   wish i could steal this girl and make her my employee which to me is an obvious sign of great training !  !  thankyou boston chicken on ridge rd in parma !  !  !  i will be back
__label__4 what a stinking  ( but not literally )  cute cafi .   admittedly ,  i ' ve driven by the tower press building a thousand times ,  but never went in .  during sparx city hop ,  i finally stopped in for a tea after exploring the building from the sparx blue line .  .  .  and now i don ' t know why i didn ' t sooner .  for starters ,  the cafi isn ' t exclusive to tower press residents and artists .  anyone can stop in .  it definitely has an artsy vibe ,  which is totally enhanced by the residents and artists who pass through .  they also have art and jewelry on display ,  and some cozy ,  colorful seating .  really good feng shui and vibes coming out of this shop .   to my surprise ,  they also have a small food menu !  i came in expecting a small coffee menu ,  but ended up just craving lunch .  i had a small chai tea latte to-go ,  but i will definitely come back here in the future for lunch ,  and maybe even to hang and get some work done .  artefino is a little off the beaten path of the regular coffee shops ,  and i love that .  don ' t be discouraged by parking .  .  . there ' s free parking in the back of the building ! 
__label__3 artefino is a good place to grab coffee in the morning .  the service here is outstanding and the staff is very friendly and personable .  the breakfast sandwiches are good ,  i suggest the egg and cheese on multigrain bread .  i only order black coffee and it tastes like better coffee than i could brew .  there is some artwork hanging on the walls and on display behind glass cases .  a little too expensive for my budget .  good to look at while waiting for food regardless .  the lunch sandwiches are alright .  if you are on this side of town ,  you should stop in .  if you are not really close ,  you probably should not drive that far because it is something that you could get somewhere else without a slew of bums hanging out by a church smoking rock asking you for some money . 
__label__4 fast and friendly service !  very pleasant environment ,  and local art- what ' s not to love ? 
__label__3 impressive and significant architecture and design and a good second choice hotel for a stay in cleveland .  the hotel is designed so that most of the rooms overlook a magnificent courtyard that it open to the public .  on one side of the hotel the elevators are controlled by key cards but on the other side the elevators are generally open to the public but the hotel doors are controlled by key cards after 7 and there might b a security guard present  .  the room doors are made of heavy wood and the glass windows are covered by wooden shutters .  it ' s cute  ,  it ' s novel but if you ' re overly concerned about safety this may not b your place .  the rest .  1860 serves a good breakfast .   i rate it 4 stars but for my experience at check in .  the first room they assigned to me wreaked of stale cigarette smoke ,  the second room they gave me did not have a desk .  each time i went back to express concern i was told that they were fully booked and had no other availability .  yet each time they came up with an alternative room , one a bit better situated than the next  .  this led me to conclude that they were intent on proving first the least desirable rooms .  not a good practice . 
__label__1 i was glad to be leaving .     first off ,  i totally got the whole concept - building a hotel around a historic arcade .    but .  .  .  converting the old shops ,  with interior windows ,  no less ,  into drab rooms ?  come on .   i was in denial as i was dragging my suitcase from the tiny reception area to my room - this cannot be happening .   but it was .     and soon i found myself in a small rectangular room with ugly furniture ,  heavily curtained glass door and what looked like a shopfront window  ( for obvious reasons )  behind me and three windows with curtains that could hardly open on the far wall in front of me overlooking .  .  .  the second floor of a big parking garage .   i kid you not .  said garage was so close that i could see the cars parked there and decided that i probably wouldn ' t call to complain about the curtains that didn ' t open after all .   throughout the whole stay i came to a conclusion that there ' s no way natural light could get into the room .   instead ,  the room ' s source of light  is the garage ' s big fluorescent bulbs .   at least ,  i thought to myself ,  there was consistency .     it was room 225 .   yelpers beware .    by far the worst hotel i ' ve ever stayed in .   and i ' m not even discounting skanky-ass motels that i used to stay at roadtrippin '  during my college days .   maybe it ' s the expectation gap .   when you hear hyatt you expect a certain level of standard that this hotel failed to meet .    i was glad i won ' t be coming back . 
__label__3 in summary ,  the cleveland hyatt is form over function .    beautiful hotel that looks like something out of boardwalk empire !  i do like the concept of repurposing space- the hyatt used to be the arcade ,  a retail hub that has a beautiful open center / atrium ,  with hotel rooms replacing where little boutiques used to be .  however ,  it makes the room a bit odd via people walking by your window ,  so make sure to draw your curtains .  also ,  no refrigerator or closet to hang your suit jacket !  boo .  and none of the eateries ,  restaurants and stores were open on sunday at all ! had to go outside to e 4th st ,  which is right behind the hotel .  they do have a computer with internet and printing in the lobby . 
__label__4 i don ' t really know why there are so many negative reviews .  hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful .  we booked adjoining rooms  ( 1 double and 1 king )  .  the rooms were clean and with the high ceilings felt huge .  tvs are not flat screen but i didn ' t come to cleveland to watch tv .  the arcade is cool .  granted there are not a lot of stores but the hotel dominates most of the structure with rooms wrapping all around the arcade .  across the street from the hotel was plenty of nightlife so i don ' t know what one reviewer means about it being dead .   triple a rate gave us free breakfast .  all in all this was a very nice property and great place to stay . 
__label__4 truly great space with a unique old-world feel ,  friendly & accommodating staff ,  clean comfortable rooms ,  and a quick walk to stadiums ,  bars and restaurants .  breakfast in the dining room was delicious and we enjoyed chatting with our upbeat & friendly server veronica .  the city itself is clearly weathering some hard times and this is reflected in the shops at the arcade  ( would ' ve been nice to have a few touristy or artsy shops to browse )  ,  but if i return to cleveland this would be my first choice .   ( got a great rate on a travel site ,  probably would have been disappointed if i ' d paid the full listed rate .  ) 
__label__4 i ' m glad i ignored all the negative reviews of this hotel -- most of them about the noise -- because this was a great stay .   yes the arcade is noisy and echo-y; anyone sensitive to that noise should a )  still stay here anyway but b )  ask for a room off the arcade .   ( our friends did and they said they didn ' t hear a thing .  )   i ' d also ask for a newly renovated room; we did and it was very modern and clean looking .   the location just can ' t be beat .  you ' re across the street from the bustling restaurants and nightlife of east 4th street ,  and from pour ,  one of the best coffee shops in cleveland .  it ' s a five minute walk to the teminal tower ,  where you can get the subway and be at the airport in under 30 minutes .     the staff was friendly ,  and helpful .   the bad ?   we got a wake up call we didn ' t ask for .  we had some phone charges on our bill that weren ' t ours ,  but they were removed no questions asked .   and yes ,  the noise from the arcade was a little loud at times ,  but i ' m not bothered by that too much . 
__label__5 i visited this hotel back in april on easter sunday .  i was there for a week and the service was amazing !  there was a few issues when i got there like the ac didn ' t work in my room but after notifying the front desk i was moved to another room .  the second room had unclean sheets and after i reported it they sent someone up right away and offered me a credit .  the doormen were always polite and helpful .  since they knew my co workers and i were from texas they kept us up to date on the weather even offered us umbrellas .  the ladies that bought my room service every morning were the sweetest and they anticipated all my needs .  i didn ' t care for my server in the hotel restaurant he was very dry .  despite that the atmosphere of the restaurant was very relaxing and excellent food .  the little shops ,  boutiques and restaurants inside of the hotel makes it a must stay .  if i am ever in cleveland again i will be staying here again . 
__label__3 check in was smooth and easy ,  clogged toilet was taken care of quick !  thx jose !  decided to do a little gambling at the horse shoe ,  came back to the hotel around 10:30pm and went to the front desk to ask for a late check out .  the women at the fd looked  at me and asked me for my room number and before i was able to finish with the last number she said sorry ,  check out is at noon .  i  was a little disappointed so i went back up to my room and waited for about an hour and called down to fd  but this time i used my most professional white person ' s voice and grammar and asked for a late check out for 2pm ,  fd was more than gladly to help me .  i was wowed ,  but at 12pm the maid still came and knocked on my door .  .  . 
__label__2 not up to hyatt standards .   this was a very mediocre hotel with a small uncomfortable room ,  poor service ,  and the location is not as great as it looks .   starting with the room ,  there is no small seating area or place to get comfortable other than the bed .  the shower curtain has thick black mold down by the bottom of it .  the beds are uncomfortable and do not have fitted sheets ,  meaning you are directly touching the mattress by the next morning .   the staff is unprofessional and lazy .  there were eight valets lurking around at all times with nothing to do .  because the main lobby is on a higher level than street level ,  they were joking around and acting unprofessionally like they were playing not working .  at a holiday inn or budget inn ,  this might be ok .  at a hyatt that advertises as 4 stars it is absolutely unacceptable .   the location appears to be the best possible location in downtown cleveland .  indeed ,  it is immediately next to the best restaurant district in the region .  but otherwise .  .  . nothing .  it is like walking thru a ghost town .  tuesday night ,  7p ,  no one is around .  we walk up and down streets and are the only people other than transients .  this is not the hotel ' s fault specifically ,  but it contributed to this feeling like a place we most definitely did not want to be .  it is not a living city ,  it is a dead city with some large "happenings" like sports stadium ,  casino ,  etc .  but otherwise no shopping ,  no life ,  no culture .  it would be a great setting for a dystopian disaster movie to use to show that large ,  impressive and somewhat beautiful architectural cities are no longer inhabited and now represent just a waste land .   so ,  thumbs down for cleveland downtown in general ,  and a categorical "avoid" for this hyatt .  it is absolutely not up to hyatt standards and the purveyors should be ashamed . 
__label__4 delivery was faster than projected .  pizza was really good .  cheese was delicious .  i was very surprised and satisfied . 
__label__5 finally found a lunch spot around here that is really clean and pleasant .  $5 for two big pizza slices and a drink . 
__label__3 some good ,  some not so good .  coworker and i placed an order for lunch .  we asked that the order be delivered at 12:30 which was when our lunch started .  instead it arrived at 12 .  that means it had to sit for half an hour before we could eat it .  so we had to reheat .  some people might not mind food coming earlier ,  but  ,  when you ' re not allowed to touch it until 1230 and it comes at 12 ,  well ,  you see my issue .  so ,  after we reheated the cold pizza and potatoes ,  it was pretty good .  fries rarely re heat well and these were no exception .  pizza was ok .   i would ' ve like to have tried it fresh  .  i also got the veggie wrap .  it was good ,  but messy ,  and also the stem was left on my banana pepper ,  and i didnt notice said and i gagged on it .  could have done without the stem guys .  all in all ,  i probably won ' t order again . 
__label__4 this is a pretty nice little wine bar .  the wine list has a good variety and range of prices should suit everyone ' s budget .   we were primarily there for a quick bite ,  and the food was really simple and good .  i absolutely loved the bruschetta ,  and the margherita pizza was nice and light .  perfect for one person .  we also ordered the arugula salad with strawberries ,  pecans  ( or walnuts ,  i can ' t remember )  ,  and vinaigrette .  like everything else ,  it was the perfect portion for a lighter meal .  .  . and it was delicious .   overall ,  with the positive service ,  we left with nothing to complain about .  hopefully it ' s the same next time we come back !  also ,  i hope to hangout for the live music a little next time .   if you ' re in little italy and not in the mood for a heavier meal ,  i ' d definitely recommend vino veritas . 
__label__4 great spot in little italy !   flat breads sooo good !   thin crust but still yeasty in flavor .   the pepperoni had a tough skin though which made it hard to chew and cut but other than that a great flavor ! 
__label__3 after reviewing the restaurant the owner continuously harassed me through yelp and facebook .  nonetheless ,  i will go ahead and complement their awesome cheese and meat board . 
__label__4 great ,  efficient place to do dry cleaning .  i like the service here .  minor inconvenience is that they don ' t take credit card for things under $10 so be aware . 
__label__1 thought i found a decent place to eat at cleveland airport - i ordered the far east salad- it ' s okay - would like more vegetables though .  the frosties - which was advertised as ice and fruits only- is sickenly sweet- they must have added sugar somehow- i had half of the regular size and could already feel sugar rush - literally .  sorry had to reduce to 1 star due to false advertising ! 
__label__5 this place is great .  i have been twice now and get the same things .  .  .  lobster mac & cheese and the baked brie soooo good ! 
__label__4 this is based on just one visit ,  so take it all with a grain of salt .  atmosphere ' s a little cold .  .  .  with just a little work this place could go from being a little too dingy for it ' s own good -- after all ,  it ' s a wine bar ,  and it seems to want to be a classier alternative to the w .  6th doucheathon -- to a warm ,  inviting ,  versatile ,  and cozy hangout / dinner spot .   biggest plus: i got a flight of four wines -- very generous pours -- for $15 .  the wine was great ,  but what do you expect .  anyway ,  you could do a lot worse .   service was prompt ,  but that ' s about all i ' ll say for it .   wasn ' t that hungry but had the beet salad .  not bad ,  but maybe the wrong choice ?  too much dressing ,  should ' ve gotten it on the side .   hope to give it another try . 
__label__3 my previous review was a 4 - and i still love the wine and tapas ,  but i just feel i need to dock this place down for service .  i ' ve been there twice after my first visit and both times the service has been horrible despite us being one of two or three tables .  i had the same waitress both these times who flocked to the table with a bunch of guys and talked to them the entire time ,  not realizing that she needed to possibly pay attention to her other tables .    but ,  the drop in my rating like i said is because of service .  i ' ll still be going back until the food quality changes . 
__label__5 so i ' m not in the business of doling out 5-star reviews ,  but .  .  .   i spent 3 years  ( 2006-2008 )  living in cleveland ,  i ate and drank 2-4 times a week at d ' vine wine bar .   the bartenders and servers were super personable and i always felt at home there .   last thing ,  but maybe the most important is the food ,  it is amazing !  seriously amazing ,  they change the menu up occasionally but always make sure to keep the perennial favorites on there .   they had a duck confit pizza that was out of this world  ( i ' d call it more of a flatbread but who cares )  .   prices are fine ,  service is good and wine list is quite well rounded .   finally ,  just to illustrate the at-home feeling i always got when i was there ,  they picked up and stocked ginger beer and a dark rum  ( that they even wrote my name on )  so i could drink dark and stormy ' s there !   love  ' em ! 
__label__4 this is a nice retreat from the drunken crazies on the rest of the street .  personally ,  if i wanted to just go to a wine bar and not bar hop ,  i would pick a different wine bar ,  perhaps market ave or wine bar rocky river ,  or something in willoughby if i lived over that way .  but ,  if you want to go downtown and start off mellow ,  d ' vine is a nice option .    also ,  it is a nice place to flirt over happy hours .  men in suits . 
__label__1 i just threw away $24 . 00 for two online tickets to the "tall ship festival" .   there were no tall ships for one .   there was one little schooner and the advertised world war ll ship never showed due to technical diifficulties .   also no vendors even though art in the park class vendors were promised .   stayed 5-10 minutes and walked out .   ripoff . 
__label__4 oh great ,  yet another craving to attempt to resist .   steak  ' n shake !   i was surprised to be greeted at the door ,  seated ,  and waited on .   i didn ' t realize that this wasn ' t just your "run of the mill" fast-food restaurant .   there ' s actually table service .   what ?   everyone was very attentive and professional .   i even liked the decor ,  if you could call it that--sort of a wannabe  ' 50s diner thing .   it was very clean too .   i liked the red / black / white color scheme .   everyone wore a white button-down shirt and a black bow tie .   my husband had the double steakburger ,  which was amazing !   my chicken sandwich was eh .   i won ' t get it again .   we also tried a hot dog which was also quite tasty .   i like the idea that this doubles as a drive-thru ,  so you can get it quick and to go ,  or you can sit down and get your soda in a real glass .   pretty cool .   also ,  the fries weren ' t my favorite ,  but they were still hot and crispy .   three additional highlights:   1 )  they offer flavor shots for your drinks !   2 )  they have coke zero .  3 )  the shaaaaakkkkeeees !  i haven ' t had a shake in forever .   i got the chocolate and it was just divine .   i couldn ' t even finish it ,  not because i didn ' t want to ,  but because it was so thick that it was taking too long .   we took it to go and now it ' s in my freezer for later .   mmmm .   the bathrooms were also clean and spacious .    ( that one was for you ,  will s .   i know you love to hear about the bathrooms .  ) 
__label__5 i went here with a group of cle yelpers as part of the 2012 monthly international supper club night .     with its log cabin like architecture and decor ,  private expansive parking on e55th ,  this gem of a place is one of my new found favorite .   as you step inside ,  and begin this walk down long corridor the lighting increasingly dims and you start to wonder where am i going .   i can imagine such a long corridor provides some much welcome shelter as you wait in line during their famous weekend night festivities or private parties .    once you step into the main dining room you feel like you have escaped into a warm ,  mountaintop eastern european chalet with dark wood and many cultural relics hanging on the walls .   you are immediately transported to mood where you are hungry for some coma inducing comfort food .     the food indeed is comfort food .   if you count your daily calorie intake ,  then leave the calorie calculation out of your records for a meal here .   the food is not drowned in grease but are prepared with butter in traditional eastern european fashion .  wienerschnitzel ,  roast pork ,  sausage ,  potato ,  sauerkraut ,  strudel and many other slovenian ethnic items can be found here .   all served up with the comforting touch of sweet motherly ladies who have the good balance of  ' eat it ,  this is good for you '  and  ' you sure you want that ?  '  kind of demeanor .   you can tell they might not appreciate smarty aleck but they sure are helpful to those who need advice on what to order .   the family style choice is the best for the first timers or those who want to get a variety of items to try .   the wienerschnitzel is served crispy without tasting like its drenched in grease .   the roast pork with gravy is cooked soft to your palette but still holds its shape well and not at all drenched in salty taste .  sausage is likely steam cooked and come slightly red .   although this could be misleading to some as undercooked ,   let me assure you there nothing undercooked about it .   its perfect .   sauerkraut tastes great with its combined taste of sugar ,  wine ,  garlic ,  and salt .   one bite and if you are a sauerkraut lover ,  you will not put it down .   potato this dish is served with sautied diced potato slightly mashed with bacon bits and butter combined .   this side-dish as well can ' t be put down once you start .   i ' m already starting to crave more as i write this .   i had the apple strudel ,   although i ' m not a big fan of this item ,   it was an absolute fine finish to my meal .   the accompanying lasko  ( slovenian beer )  was a great pairing to my order .    they also have pitcher of beer as you might expect .   sterle ' s is the best choice in cleveland for eastern european cuisine that is served up with love for the love of your hunger and comfort for your taste bud .   sweet ,  sweet pleasure . 
__label__4 please at least go to a place like this before they disappear from the face of cleveland .   not saying it is closing soon ,  but time is not friendly to these types of places .   as generations change ,  neighborhoods shift ,  and traditions get lost ,  these places get rarer and rarer . 
__label__5 we held a reception in sterle ' s banquet room and it could not have been any better .   jill ,  the catering manager could not have been more helpful or accommodating .   i felt that the prices were very reasonable and everyone loved the food .  we served appetizers and chose a dinner buffet of roast beef ,  pierogies ,  sausage & kraut ,  mashed potatoes ,  and vegetables .   everyone raved about it and there was plenty .   the sausage is made by a local butcher per their old secret recipe .   pierogies were also home made .  here are a few other points that i really liked: *set up-we dropped off fresh flower arrangements and special serving ware .   all was set up per our directions and looked beautiful .   they also provide some mason jar arrangements that you can use ,  but we brought our own .  *room has a small dance floor and music system .   you can bring in an ipad or iphone loaded with your pandora playlist and party music is taken care of .  *room had projector and screen .   bring in your photo presentation and they will take care of you .  *friday nights -  a polka band plays in the main dining room where you are welcome to go out and dance .  *bring in your cake - they will set up your cake table ,  offered to cut the dessert ,  and provided take home containers for the remaining desserts .   we also brought in a cookie jar with homemade cookies and chocolate from lily ' s without a problem .  * buffet - set up on time and were attentive .  *white table cloths provided at no charge .   i think some places try to nickel and dime you on things like linens .    *buffet - plenty of food that was yummy and they provided containers that allowed guests to take home the leftovers .  *patio- if the weather would have been warmer ,  we could have enjoyed the patio off of our room .  *non-alcoholic champagne-while they do not offer it ,  they allowed us to bring in some of our own for toasting .  *cute little chalkboard signs were provided to designate the cake table ,  gift table ,  etc .  *private parking lot had plenty of room for our guests .  *room will seat 125 guests . 
__label__1 two years ago the sunday bloody mary bar was excellent & reasonable .  now half the condiments for the bloody mays are gone and prices soaring .   over priced drinks with an ever changing prices on the bbq food .  the bbq rib was like jerky and pulled pork was dry & fatty .   they had no business the day i stopped , so must be the last person to know how much they went down hill .   man m bummed my favorite stop ended up like this . 
__label__4 oh my ,  oh my - i think i ' m in love .    my main weakness in life is anything with a lot of culture ,  especially if that culture comes along with a sassy owner with the best one liners in town !    this place has been on my list to try for years ,  but i never was able to .   i was thrilled to venture there during a company outing for our supper club  ( copying yelp ' s idea ,  of course !  )   you truly feel like you ' ve left cleveland ,  and the country for that fact ,  when you walk into this place .   the architecture ,  decor ,  beer list - all resemble something a little old world .     to the food .   lovely margot told me i ' d be stupid to not have the weinerschnitzel on my first visit ,  so you know what i did ?  i listened to her .   i don ' t have much to compare this to ,  being that it was my first schnitzel - but yum !   i highly recommend using the lemon that comes on top  .  .  .  really brightens the dish up .   it comes with a heap of potatoes ,  and a salad with homemade dressing or their soup of the night .   the price is high for the neighborhood ,  but the amount of food you get is almost sickening .   you ' ll be taking one schnitzel home for sure !    and dessert  .  .  .  we all showed her how full we were ,  but she insisted - and we ' re glad she did .   the strudel was very good !    she brought out two ,  but cut it up into tiny pieces so we could each have a little sample .   it was the perfect way to end the meal .     i will be back for sure ,  and not just for the food .   i ' m very intrigued that they have a polka night .   what ?   accordion ?  old men teaching me out to polka dance ?  - has to be a hilarious good time . 
__label__4 i used to think das schnitzel haus had the best schnitzel .   i also used to think they had the best kraut .  wow ,  i was wrong .   i didn ' t even know sterle ' s existed until i was invited to dinner by family friends .   i don ' t get out to the eastside much i guess .     we went on a friday at 5:30 and i was expecting a wait - no wait !   it ' s a pretty big place with ample seating - kind of reminded me of the beer hall at the german festival at the fairgrounds .   long bench seating ,  hand painted wall murals ,  and live polka music .   the atmosphere was fun - a bit loud for conversation but who needs that anyways !   sterle ' s offers family style dining for parties of 8 or more so we opted for that  ( at $20 a person )  .   it gave us the opportunity to try multiple main courses .   we enjoyed the weinerschnitzel ,  the chicken paprikash ,  slovanian sausage ,  sauerkraut ,  dumplings ,  and green beans .   it was all fantastic .   if you can ' t find 7 friends to take then you can ' t go family style - too bad for you .   if i had to choose just one dish .  .  .   ( 10 minutes goes by )  .  .  .  i wouldn ' t be able to !   the waitress was friendly ,  the food came out quickly ,  and the manager checked in on us multiple times .   they were wonderful .   round up 7 friends  ( or hungry strangers )  and go here ! 
__label__2 chas m nailed it .    food was ok .    service was very slow .   the amazing thing is there are a ton of reviews that all say the same thing .   management not paying attention . 
__label__5 i ' ve been coming here since i was a kid .  sterle ' s is a cleveland institution .  the food is delicious ,  the murals are beautiful and the owners are exceptionally community minded .  check it out !   also go to a polka night ! 
__label__3 if you are ever in the neighborhood ,  do yourself a favor and drop in for a quick meal .  the food is so so ,  but the atmosphere is amazing .  close your eyes ,  count to five ,  and open them again and you might just think you are in eastern europe .  the wait staff is authenticly dressed .  the food is hearty and filling ,  but far from fantastic .  don ' t go for the food ,  go for the atmosphere . 
__label__3 i went here for a friend ' s birthday dinner service was great even though we had a large group .  you get big portions with your meal i had the country house chicken it was good ,  but i wasn ' t inspired to think wow i need to get this dish again .  i also had some palacinka ,  a crepe-like dessert filled with jelly and cream .  i liked the crepe part ,  but the filling was too sweet for me after eating half of it ,  and the jelly just tasted like some regular smucker ' s strawberry jelly to me . 
__label__3 what a great surprise to find such a gem attached to the market .  college girls reunion weekend and we were starving after all the shopping !  we popped in here and were really surprised by the unique menu .   i had the lamb slider appetizer which was the perfect size for lunch for one .  three little sandwiches ,  each with a dollop of tomato ,  cucumber ,  onion and feta on each .   sweet potato tots were very tasty ,  but needed some sort of sauce to accompany .   two of my friends had the wild mushroom grilled cheese and couldn ' t put it down . 
__label__4 jess and i went to the west side market cafe this afternoon while shopping the west side market .  first off ,  we thought it was really friendly ,  so there ' s a plus right there .  next ,  the food was pretty decent .  jess had the apple smoked bbq chicken wrap and i had the smoked salmon blt .  both were really good ,  and exceeded our expectations .    as for the decor ,  it reminded us of an old building with really solid concrete brick walls and the smell that goes along with it .  but still ,  great stuff .  we enjoyed it and everyone there .  four stars because the food wasn ' t that special ,  but it was a great retreat in the middle of a crazy market .   as a side note ,  they don ' t sell breakfast after 12 on saturday ,  which our server was nice enough to tell us right away  ( when i ordered coffee )  . 
__label__5 best meal i have ever eaten .  get the waffles with preserves and whipped cream .  the cream is homemade ,  the preserves are too !  i loved it !  still thinking about it months later !  smoky hash was also great ! 
__label__5 came back this weekend for breakfast before i explored the market .  still great - got the same exact thing  ( why mess with what works ?  )  .  the place was much busier than my previous visit which i attribute to the market actually being open  ( i came last time on a sunday )  .  i got a table quickly though .    every time i eat here ,  i want to move to cleveland . 
__label__5 this place is seriously amazing for breakfast .   good price amazing food .   can ' t wait to get back and try other things on the menu . 
__label__4 you know a place is good when every one else is closing or offering 2 for one specials but at the west side market cafe you still have to wait in line to get in .  i first visited the cafe on a really hot day in june because there is a big sign that said "ice cream" .  guess what ?  they don ' t serve ice cream .  apparently the sign is a relic of an ancient incarnation of the space .  but stumbling on it like that was a very lucky day for me .  attached to the west side market the cafe has easy access to some of the freshest ,  most flavorable and diverse food in this part of the country .  now i have seen some great food turned mediocre by an inept kitchen .  fortunately the chef  ( and he is certainly a "chef" not not not a short order cook )  has mastered the art of creating great dishes out of great food .  the breakfast menu is not two eggs over easy bacon and toast .  they have three or four variations on eggs benedict .  the hash is made with andouille sausage and the pancakes are served with real maple syrup .  the hash browns have bits of onion and green and red pepper .  unbelievably good .  lunch and dinner includes perfectly created dishes from the best ingredients at the market .  this is food you expect to find at a fine dining establishment and food that fits perfectly at a casual diner .  in other words there is something for everyone .  the owners are everywhere .  every customer is treated like a long time regular whether it is your first visit or if you have been sitting in the same seat since the day they opened .  the service is quick and efficient even on a busy day and your coffee cup is like the cornucopia ,  it stays filled all day . 
__label__4 we came to the westside market hungry ,  and popped into the cafe for breakfast before shopping .  i loved my "market hash" with its generous chunks of spicy andouille sausage  ( which seemed to be the major component of the dish )  ,  potato ,  green peppers ,  and onions .  my dining companion had three of the thickest pancakes i ' ve think i ' ve ever seen ,  dusted lightly with powdered sugar and served with a generous helping of fresh fruit .  .  . and he said they were quite good as well !  loved the vintage diner atmosphere here ,  and the wait staff ' s friendly banter with the regulars .  service was quick and attentive .  i ' d f ' sure be a regular if we didn ' t live a couple hundred miles away from cleveland !  i also enjoyed the vintage photos on the wall - a couple of photos taken during the market ' s construction hung above our table . 
__label__4 breakfast was really good and we all fell in love with the rosemary bread / toast .  our meals included omelets ,  sausage gravy over toast  ( sounds weird to me but hubby liked it a lot )  and super good and actually crispy like we ordered them hash browns .    i had to decide if this would be a 3 star or 4 star review .   i bumped it up to 4 stars because of the historical aspect - kinda cool to realize how old the building is and you have to give props to a place that ' s been around as long as it has .   the food was a bit expensive ,  imho .   we were there during the week for breakfast and yet no specials ?   oh ,  and the service wasn ' t stellar .  .  . a bit slow and impersonal .   we weren ' t in a hurry so it wasn ' t a big deal ,  but i can see where it could be a bit annoying . 
__label__1 not sure why this place showed up on my search but regardless ,  went with the many reviews of praise only to be sadly disappointed yet again .   it must be that what i think is good food is not the same as what others consider good food .   hell ,  i have friends that still think mcd ' s is great for breakfast .  go figure .   in saying that ,  this place is hidden inside the west side market ,  made up of a vast amount of meat markets .   lots of sausage and slabs of meat ,  one after another .   strange but interesting .   we finally found this place and it is a diner / cafe ,  lets just say .   it looked and felt more like a bar with a dining area .   anyway ,  we were hoping for breakfast but didnt make it so i settled for the wild mushroom grilled cheese ,  i was disappointed ,  maybe because i hate settling and the menu didnt offer anything else i was interested in; for me ,  a recipe for disaster .     the fries were greasy and the sandwich was so sour ,  i could not even finish the first half .   and i was so hungry .   my bf has the pulled pork which was also ,  meh .  he attempted to finish mine but he also found it to be sour .   he ate his because ,  yes ,  he was hungry .   nothing worse than eating something that you dislike just for the possible nutrition content and to rid yourself of hunger pangs .   : (   sorry i couldnt give this place a better review ,  it is what it is . 
__label__3 wavering between 3-3 . 5 stars .  very cute and busy little cafe inside the west side market  ( which i love and come to frequently )  .  i ordered a mushroom omelet with hash browns and bread .  the best part of the breakfast was definitely the mushrooms  ( good variety ,  and presumably they were from the market )  and the bread  ( rosemary bread ,  toasted and buttered perfectly !  also presumably from the market .  )  i could eat the rosemary bread forever .  the hash browns w /  onions and peppers were also good ,  but i ' m a sucker for anything with fried potatoes .   what ' s left is the egg from the omelet .  .  .  it was overcooked and a bit rubbery .  i felt a little disappointed that i wasn ' t able to finish it .  seems like the execution and cooking needs some work .    great place to meet up with friends after a trip to the market though . 
__label__1 food is what one would expect at denny ' s - not very healthful .   ( the chicken burrito had much mayonnaise or similar dressing in it - why ?  )  styrofoam plates and plasticware are easy on kitchen logistics but take away  whatever dining-out joy remains after peeling your shoes off the sticky floor with every step .   ( i understand the dangers of maple-flavored syrup ,  but stickiness is my pet peeve .  and sugar dissolves so easily in water .  )   iced tea rating: 1 / 5 stars this barely-tea-colored liquid was indistinguishable from water by taste .   ( but at least it didn ' t taste like coffee .  )  the restaurant seems to possess a standard tea brewing apparatus ,  so some procedural snafu might be at fault . 
__label__5 fast courteous and fair ,  he came out on sunday and looked at what was wrong with my dryer ,  he had on hand one of the 2 parts needed .   gave me a 20 minute window of when he would be back the next day ,  went to worked he called when he was on his way to finish the job .   nicest guy ,  i would recommend and will use him again . 
__label__5 i used to love to go here when i was a cwru student .  the woman at the coat check was always so friendly .  recently i called them to order a book i saw on line & the woman was friendly & the book came promptly .  i ' d love so very much to go back there but i ' m unable to travel right now .  when i call their recording of exhibitions it ' s always educational & informative .  i like their website .  i can see many of the works that i saw many years ago .  i really miss the place & wish i could come back & visit . 
__label__5 have been going to the museum since i can remember and it presents interesting contrasts .    cma is one of the great art museums in the world; made even more amazing by the fact that general admission is still free for everyone .   while many museums have a specific focus or concentration ,  cma gives you one of the best broad overviews of fine art around the world and over the centuries .   you can easily spend several days or get through in a couple hours depending on how much time you spend in each gallery .   lets hit some high points:  the new atrium has brought cma into the 21st century ,  tying the whole museum together .   check out the interactive multimedia area just to your left as you come in the main entrance .   there is also a gallery that features special exhibits from the collection across from the store .   cma finally has a very nice museum store with some interesting items .   there is a nice quick service restaurant serving upscale food and provenance which provides excellent themed menus of high quality food .   one gallery that seems to have not changed in many years is the armor court and this is as it should be .   a favorite with kids ,  it is also fascinating to adults .   full armor for man and horse ,  weapons ranging from swords ,  pikes and crossbows all from fairly simple to very ornate .   when you are in here don ' t forget to look up for the items hung high on the walls .    there are great and important pieces throughout the museum .   i always look forward to checking out the modern art and photography galleries to see how they have been updated .   i also really enjoy the new galleries displaying asian art .   i await the revised japanese and korean galleries when they reopen in may .      the special exhibits are excellent ,  and most times you can spend a full day at whatever is up currently .   there is plenty of parking in the area ,  both on the street and in the attached garage .   cma is a cannot miss if you are visiting cleveland; if you live here and haven ' t been in a while ,  it is well worth checking out again . 
__label__5 i was in cleveland for an indians game and we had an afternoon to kill so we went to check out the local art museum .   i had never heard anything about it before and was surprised when we arrived to find it was free - quite a rare thing these days .   i am not very knowledgeable about art ,  but i have browsed my way through several and always found something to enjoy .   i was stunned to see the high quality collections from roman mosaics all the way through a present-day video installation .   i really enjoyed the museum and would say it was the highlight of my recent trip to cleveland . 
__label__5 beautiful museum ,  we spend hours looking at the amazing collections .  we could have used another day to take it all in .  the cafe was impressive as well . 
__label__5 in any city ,  in any country ,  there is a respite of beauty called the art museum .  abandon snark ,  all ye who enter here  ( until you get to the modern art section ,  then you can roll eyes as much as you want .  go ahead ,  it ' s just a canvas painted white ,  after all - says the art history student )  .   a lovely walk across the green to the front door ,  free coat check ,  free admission and after the initial confusion over where to start ,  i found myself whisked through the space organically and chronologically with ease .    the collections are laid out perfectly and in spite of its size  ( so you think )  ,  there are so many wonderful pieces ,  notable time periods and important artists represented that it ' s impossible to leave unsatisfied .  the curator has done an impeccable job ,  especially with the opportunities for information via laminated plaques ,  audio walking tours and docents .  even the security guys are helpful with directions .  i can ' t wait to see what the new wings have in store !   little tip: don ' t ,  um ,  lean in too close to the work .  i set off a buzzer and heard several more going off throughout the space during the day .  whoops .  : ) 
__label__5 i absolutely hate when people say that a place is good  ' for cleveland '  .    thankfully ,  even those fond of this lame faux praise won ' t need to pull it out for cma .  dammit ,  this museum is great ,  period .  especially for being free ,  i ' d stack it up against anywhere for value of experience .  very well curated ,  wonderful rotating exhibits .  the tags with each piece say much more than just name of the piece and artist name - lots of info about time and context .  i love just walking around and looking at things that look cool and actually learning stuff about it .    not just paintings ,  not just one era - there ' s plenty here for all interests .  the impressionist galleries are lovely .  plenty of monet ,  degas and van gogh and one of my favorites ,  pissaro .  i also love the armor collection and renaissance era tapestries and flags .   they have impressive holdings ,  so you can come often and not see the same old stuff - even though you might want to because the  ' same old stuff '  is totally awesome !  big enough where you can spend several hours looking around ,  small enough as to not be overwhelming .    the new atrium is stunning - a beautiful way to merge the old and new .  huge ,  bright and quiet even with many people inside .   i also highly recommend the  ' first friday '  happy hour events they hold outside in the summer and in the atrium in the winter .  $8 gets you a good time with entertainment and a cash bar - a different theme each month .    fantastic and just keeps getting better .  an awesome asset to cleveland ' s rather impressive cultural scene .    definitely go when in town visiting .  go often if in town to stay . 
__label__5 i love free museums  ( okay ,  pay what you want museums )  .  the cleveland art museum is easy to navigate and has an impressive collection of master and minor works .  it is certainly not comprehensive  ( and leans toward the white male artist ,  although their recent exhibitions are significantly more diverse )  ,  but it ' s a lovely way to spend an afternoon .  some exhibitions ,  although not all ,  are ticketed .  don ' t forget to wander the grounds and nearby sculpture garden in nice weather ! 
__label__5 had a great time there today with my wife .  only complaint was that they closed too early .  love that it ' s free !  a must for anyone in town who enjoys art or art history . 
__label__4 who knew that cleveland boasted a beautiful gem of an art museum ?  we spent two hours there and never got to the side with the modern art .  i loved the romanov exhibit .  there are some special exhibits ,  but we had no time there ,  either  ( and i ' ve been to pompeii )  .   best of all ?  it ' s free . 
__label__4 classic ice cream place with some great food specials .   old school feel and great group of adults and kids serving good stuff .   worth a visit for some good treats . 
__label__4 i wish they were open right now .  i know they have a ridiculous amount of soft serve flavors ,  but i would just order vanilla and chocolate swirl and it would be delicious and i would eat it while pretending it ' s 1987 .  i like this place and i hope it reopens ! 
__label__2 went here on a friday night about 6pm and noone else here before ,  during or after we left .  waitress standing around bsing .  food did not live up to price .  another "gem" we were disappointed in .  we will not be back . 
__label__4 great steak and potato dinner joint .   the service was friendly and somewhat prompt .   the piano player was nice in the background . 
__label__5 welcome ,  is exactly how i feel when i walked into this establishment .   i ' ve been here twice with my wife and and my wife and a few friends another time .   not a fluke .   both times i instantly felt at home and at ease .   some places make you guess at how they do things ,  not here .   here it is the common practice ,  drink ,  food ,  order and you receive it .   staff is all friendly ,  ownership takes an honest approach ,  and an interest in your thoughts and comments .   i urge you ,  if you have a real problem ,  to talk to the owner ,  with calm discussion ,  i ' m sure they will do what they can for you .    ( if your in there and it ' s wall to wall because it ' s an indians game ,  be patient ,  it is a small establishment ,  they can only serve so many )    ( be realistic ,  you don ' t get service at a stadium setting the same way you would on a dead tuesday evening )  .     the atmosphere is casual ,  as when last in here we were amongst  a group of friends ,  cops ,  a few people just getting a bite to eat and take in a game at the bar ,  and an entire wedding party / family .   it ' s comfortable ,  open ,  and dark .    ( for me that ' s a great thing ,  it ' s dark in a classy way )    ( too many places like to light up the world ,  and that ' s just not relaxing after having to deal with day to day problems that life can throw at you .  .  . when you want to get away and just have fun ,  this is a place that works great .   )   even when it got busier ,  you could easily handle conversation without yelling or straining to hear ,  as it takes mass of sound well .   making it a great place to meet friends for skillfully made drinks ,  by efficient ,  friendly but not overbearing bartenders .    ( including on tap rootbeer )  .   food is prepared with fresh ingredients .    this does not mean food is  ( here ' s your piece of meat ,  with some veggies steamed on it )  .   not by a long shot .   you can tell that the owners ,  and their head chef share a passion for food .   layers of flavor are common .   not stacked upon one another ,  but readied for your enjoyment through different mastered techniques of the culinary arts .    the food is a step above what you would expect  .  .  . if not many steps above ,  of the establishment it is in .   we joked with the owner that we would love to franchise him .   once the word gets out about the food there will be no stopping them .    ( this is a place that you could take in a game ,  or head to the other room and have a wonderful dinning experience for a special event of some sort  ( come on guys ,  you know you hate the stuffiness of a french waiter ,  , but at the same time you feel your wives deserve that "special feeling" on a fork for those birthdays and anniversaries .   goodfeller ' s can please both of your wants .     bathrooms are clean and not cramped .   as is the layout of the restaurant .     prices are reasonable ,  particularly considering the quality of food you are receiving .   200 miles ,  and not a complaint in the decision to drive there .   go for the food ,  enjoy the drink ,  leave thinking you ' ll be back .   i know we will .      thank you to all of the goodfeller ' s staff we have encountered on out outings .   t&e
__label__1 my new  ' worst-ever '  restaurant experience happened here while i had a long layover at cle airport .  i dunno if the waitress had a particularly stressful day but it sure seemed like she was on the edge of a breakdown .   she was frazzled and forgot my order  ( i suspect )  ,  considering how long it took and the fact that it wasn ' t correct .   and when i asked for some ranch dressing on the side it took another ten minutes and i had to remind her about it .     the food was unremarkable ,  not that i expect that much from an airport restaurant ,  but i sure wish i went with one of the fast food chains instead of this local joint .   i guess that ' s what i get for supporting the one place i had never heard of .  .  . 
__label__1 i would rather eat at applebee ' s than ever go back to this restaurant again .  the service was lackluster ,  and the food quality was far from what i was expecting .    upon entering ,  the bar area is cool with onyx bar .  there are several other smaller rooms for the dining areas .  we got shafted the enclosed porch .  the seating was cramped ,  the lighting didn ' t set the right atmosphere ,  and there was no ambient music in the background .    the menu looks mouthwatering ,  but that ' s about where it ends .  i salivated over the menu that was posted online all day and couldn ' t decide what i wanted because it all looked so good .  in the end though ,  it doesn ' t matter what you order because it ' s all very poor quality .  it ' s a shame all their premium ingredients are wasted in subpar meals .  the ox tail pierogis were dry with bad presentation ,  the mac & cheese noodles had the texture of play-doh ,  the salmon was well done and not medium rare as we were told it would be  ( though it did have a nice crust )  ,  and the     vegetables that accompanied the salmon had raw potatoes in them !   the manager did replace the mac & cheese dish ,  but the replacement was just as bad and inedible .  he gave the impression that somehow there was nothing wrong with their mac & cheese recipe and that somehow we were the ones in error .  they were kind enough to take it off the bill  ( after initially having the nerve to present us a bill not only before out meal was complete - how trashy - but also still with this dish on it !  )  .   needless to say ,  this is the worst "nice" restaurant that i ' ve ever eaten at in cleveland  ( or all of ohio for that matter )  .  i ' m sure a chef put a lot of effort into the development of the dishes ,  but unfortunately it ' s the execution of the meals and the experience the washington place failed at accomplishing . 
__label__4 great place for happy hour !  !  the $5 happy hour is wonderful .  their appetizers are amazing and the drinks are great .  they also have free valet .  my favorite appetizer is the calamari .   never come for dinner but i hear it is great ! 
__label__5 classic hot dog stand like your dad use to go to back in the 1970s .  nothing has changed .  the people working here ,  are working here .  they ' re nice ,  but it ' s nothing super trendy ,  don ' t expect your fancy food network tv star to show up and talk about how innovative their dogs are .  they ' re not .  it ' s just a old school place to grab a bite like you use to back in the day .   biggest issue is the rude trendy people walking into you right after you order your wiener .  yeah i see you have a nicely groom beard ,  now go find your kimchi you hipster and get out of my way .  i ' ve got to go eat my food while standing up at the shelf by the empty bun racks .    if you didn ' t read this with the voice of the muppet from "johhny t ' s tourist tips for new york" you ' re doin '  it wrong .  go watch it then come back and read this again . 
__label__4 after two try ' s i finally made a reservation to la dolce vita .  i have to admit i wasnt sure what to expect because i read some of the reviews and most of them weren ' t that flattering .  so last friday night my daughter ,  husband and i finally  got to see for ourselves if it was good or bad .  well i have to say that i thought it was excellent and it was unanimous .  my husband and daughter both ordered a spanish wine that was on special and absolutely loved it .  we then followed up with a caprese salad and pesto gnocchi which we shared .  the sauce was clean and fresh and the gnocchi was done to perfection .  the caprese salad was spot on and fresh as well .  my husband got a pizza and really enjoyed the ultra thin crust ,  but would of like it to be a bit larger since it was a large .  i followed up with a nice capachinno and as usual the nice fruit tray .  the one thing that made the night even better was our waiter .  he was attentive and knowledgeable and was super friendly .  we really appreciated that .  loved the atmosphere and could see going back again . 
__label__5 had a great night at ldv .  went to hear some nice piano music by neal todten and sat inside ,  right near their old-fashioned italian-looking bar .  the owner terry and server abdul gave us great service ,  and terry ensured the party was having a good time .  the first-course pasta sample that terry brought around was excellent -- a cheesy ,  scrumptious flavor that i can still taste 24 hours later  ( and it makes my mouth water )  .  the other pasta dish we shared in a delicious marinara .  antipasto for the table was outstanding .  my italian -anerican friend gary suggested this place and we ' re definitely going back ! 
__label__4 food was incredible !  you could tell it was fresh !  service was a little slow ,  they were crowded it was live opera nite .  but food made up for it . 
__label__4 like fong ,  i actually enjoyed this restaurant .   calamari ,  stuffed peppers ,  vitello  ( in bone ,  rare )  ,  chianti classico da vinci ,  and a salmon risotto were our orders and though service was a tad slow ,  the flavourful servings were just about right in terms of sodium content .   risotto was cooked well with just a tad of stiffness left .   i suspect that ,  like fong ,  i haven ' t been eating in a little italy ,  and my standards might be too low .   on the other hand ,  i enjoyed this place thoroughly ,  despite the relatively high pricepoint .   by the way ,  the wine selection is thoroughly italian .   even the californian wines have an italian twist .   the proprietor ,  il signore tarantino ,  does indeed love the homeland .     ciao ! 
__label__1 i don ' t know about the food here but the service was terrible .     we were sat right away but waited at least 15 mins for anyone to say anything to us .   an unapologetic waiter then came and took our appetizer order ,  only to disappear for another 20 mins .   we politely told the waiter that we were not going to have dinner there and just to go ahead and bring the check for the appetizer .   again without any kind of apology ,  he walked off and this time just did not come back !   not knowing whether we had a check to pay or not ,  we asked for a manager and even he would not come out !     everyone was about as rude and unprofessional as they could be ,  except the busser ,  who was on top of refilling our water .   i ' ve been to little italy several times and always had pretty decent service so this was disappointing .   we may have gotten a bum hostess ,  waiter and manager ,  but with all the other places to eat on the street i would see no reason to go with this one .     we walked across the street to mia bella ,  which has the same atmosphere ,  but the people there were 10x more professional and the food was good . 
__label__4 one of my fav little italy spots !  they always treat you like family !  the sangria is divine and all of the pastas and pizzas are to die for !  !  always fun to sit outside in the summer !  love it here
__label__1 horrible service ,  horrible food ,  overpriced .   we always try new places .  won ' t be back here except for the wine .  it was good .  we paid $100 for cold ,  tough ,  tasting like its out of a can food !  !  very disappointed .  the meat was cold ,  yet overcooked and the pasta was undercooked .  the sauce tasted like chef boyardee out of a can .  . 
__label__4 my parents and i went here during the dinner rush and food came quickly .  the waitress at the front was very kind and seated us immediately outside in a relaxing and scenic area .  the complimentary bread is obviously straight out of the oven as it was still warm and crunchy on the dish .  there ' s also a complimentary salad that ' s pretty tasty as well .  there ' s multiple waiters and they were all attentive quick and delightful .  i ordered the pollo pomodoro ,  my dad ordered the chicken parmesan ,  and my mom ordered the chicken salad .  portions are filling ,  but prices are relatively expensive .  my chicken could have had a bit more flavor but other than that i was satisfied as were my parents . 
__label__1 visited recently .   ordered a bottle of chianti .   the server poured me a small sip and i said it is ok .   it was hurried and i was busy talking with friends .   later i felt the wine is not right - this was after he had poured a glass .   i must add i had ordered a wine from their menu .   this guy comes back and says we have replaced that bottle with this bottle  ( a completely different wine )  .   rather than getting me the menu he has already chosen a wine .   anyway this wine tasted really funny .   so i told him "this wine is not good" .   he replied "what .  .  .  not good" and laughed at me  and completely ignored me and went to do his business .   i was pissed and when he came back i had to remind him that the wine is not good .   at this time he said then why did you drink the first glass .   after a little argument he took the wine back and by that time i was done .  .  .  so i ddint '  order another bottle .   at the end as i went to restroom he was sitting at bar drinking that bottle and tells me what ' s wrong with the wine .   it is a great wine .   this is not how it is done .   you can ' t return the bottle .   overall i felt unnecessary humiliated .   i have been drinking wine for 16 years and have never returned a bottle in the past .   rather than drinking this bottle himself and humiliating me again ,  the waiter could have simply send the bottle back to the distributor .   our total bill was 119 dollars on sep 3 evening for a party of seven including the already included gratuity . 
__label__4 la dolce vita is a nice gem in little italy .  and the service really sets it off .  the owner always brings over a fresh tomato with olive oil ,  a coffee drink ,  or some other treat on the house and tells you about his garden ,  his restaurant ,  and is just a fun !   the food is good all around too !  their five cheese pizza is magnificent .  it ' s a personal size ,  but it ' s light ,  crispy ,  and oh so gooey !  also ,  ladies night is a real steal !  buy a drink and get one of five pasta dishes on the house .  my guy friends feel a little snubbed ,  but i personally enjoy it ! 
__label__4 spent a lovely afternoon here with my fiancee .  we sat at the bar and were very well attended by the bartender .  he was always there asking if we needed anything else and refilling our water glasses .  after munching on a few appetizers he even brought us a plate of fruit for "dessert" .   it was nice to sit and watch the foot traffic go by on mayfield .  a wonderful way to spend an afternoon .   i ' ve had the food here and have always been pleased ,  except on ladies night  ( tuesdays i believe )  .  ugh .  worst pasta i ' ve ever had on a tuesday .  i guess that ' s what i get though .  i ' m sure the stuff is made in bulk around 4 pm and kept warm all night .  ick .    that being said ,  have always been pleased with my meals on other days .  not amazing ,  but always good people watching and great ambiance . 
__label__5 big al ' s is my go-to breakfast place .  it ' s a little rough on the edges ,  but i never wait long for a table  ( even if there ' s a line waiting when i arrive )  and the food is quick to come out .   for some odd reason ,  i ' m in love with their coffee .  i know they get it from a local cleveland roaster ,  but it ' s very smooth and robust .  their corned beef hash is my favorite in cleveland so far !  they use real corned beef-not that canned stuff- and give you a whole lot of it .    there ' s always a restaurant . com deal for here too ,  so consider buying it to save a few bucks ! 
__label__3 it smelled !   and the bathrooms are far away .   and you have to order from the bar; no one will come to your table .     but great parking lot .   the tables are multiple but not good .   the food was good and very cleveland: perogis ,  potato pancakes ,  not healthy but very good .   i would come back for a cold beer and the yummy food . 
__label__2 not sure if they ' re any different ,  but i used the left side wash and paid the $10 simple wash .  it got some of the dirt / salt off my car ,  but in the end .  .  . it didn ' t dry ,  i could still see every drip and wiper outline on the windows .  when i got out to look at the rest of it ,  my guess is the very top layer of dirt got off .  all the salt was still on the sides .  a complete waste of money .  this is my second time here ,  and i remember the first time being just as pointless  ( which is why i only chose the cheapest option )  .  it would either take 2 washes ,  1 wash and a towel dry  ( not included )  ,  or your own washing to actually clean your car . 
__label__1 we went to see the moscow ballet performance of the nutcracker .  we had to stand out in freezing temperatures queuing for 15 minutes because there was only one entrance open .  once inside there were only a couple of ushers who were overwhelmed .  we ended up searching around until we found the seats ourselves . 
__label__4 a really cozy cafe .  friendly staff and lovely atmosphere .  they have tasty simple sandwiches ,  and the coffee is good .  i especially like the chai latte .  you can sit here for hours ,  work  ,  read ,  watch the pedestrians outside : ) 
__label__4 since moving back to ohc and taking up biking this place has become at least a twice weekly am stop ,  and what ' s more ,  sometimes i even stop in just to say hi to kayla in the morning ,  have a cup of coffee and catch up on unimportant coffee talk things you know ?  what is to say ?  it ' s local .  i believe they get their coffee from caruso ' s out of brecksville ,  so while it ' s not neighborhood local ,  it ' s still ohio .  it ' s definitely worth a stop ,  especially if you ' re staying at the hostel ,  which is right down the street . 
__label__3 it ' s a cute spot ,  but the coffee beans were burnt ,  which gave my large coffee the same scorched taste .   i would rather try one of the specialty drinks next time . 
__label__4 nice atmosphere ,  good baristas .  i wandered over here just looking for some wifi ,  and ended up spending a few hours here .  wifi is password protected ,  but posted at the front counter . 
__label__3 this is a nice small coffee bar that is reminiscent of the type of coffee shop you can find in a college town .  did i mention small ?  i got an iced coffee to go since i had my parents with me and they aren ' t coffee people .  i would love to come back ,  relax and enjoy the atmosphere .  if i make it back to cleveland ,  i will definitely come back . 
__label__4 i stumbled upon this little treasure the day after christmas .  i had my heart set on the great lakes brewery ,  but they were closed .   low and behold ,  across the brick street ,  was the koffie cafe .    i ordered the roasted marshmallow latte with an apricot tea cake .   the service was wonderful ,  and although it was a bit pricey  ( $8 total for 2 items )  ,  i will definitely be back when i venture back to cleveland . 
__label__5 great incubator .  we started our company ,  clevelandkraut . com ,  out of there and were able to scale up at the right speed .  now we have graduated from cclk and have our own processing facility .  the staff is very helpful and responsive .  kitchen has all the amenities needed for any type of food product production .   the cclk community is super rad ,  have made some life long friends and business associates there .    highly recommended . 
__label__5 i have been away from west park for several years and it was so nice to see the red lanterm with a new look and feel .  the food was very good - good portions and priced fairly .  service is excellent .   if you haven ' t been there in awhile ,  check it out .   sunday ' s brunch menu ,  with the bloody mary bar hits the spot ! 
__label__4 i got a burger with chili sauce on it and some fish tacos .  i was looking forward to it all week and it did not disappoint .  the burger was flavorful and the tacos were excellent !   i love the new food truck revolution going on and umami mobile along with a couple other excellent area trucks set a great standard that a lot of restaurants could take note of . 
__label__5 in the last couple years ,  i have tried most of the items on umami moto food truck ' s rotation and i have enjoyed all of it .   thus the upgrade to 5 stars .   my recent "curry-licious with duck" was savory ,  flavorful ,  and just really really good down to the last bite .   it comes with baby bok choy and mushrooms .   my other favs are the sweet potato tater tots with sweet curry aioli sauce ,  and the variations on vietnamese bahn mi sandwiches .   the korean bbq burrito and fish tacos are also very good .     highly recommended .   follow them on facebook to find out where to they will be ,  track them down like a hunter going after prey ,  pounce in line ,  and eat .   thanks to u . m .  for all the wonderful lunches !   : ) 
__label__4 the korean burrito ,  thumbs up !   bit of a line and about a 10 minute wait after the order ,  but it was a good burrito and i ' m now a big fan of walnut wednesdays .   live music and a good selection of trucks . 
__label__5 as a clevelander ,  just the word "steelyard" can leave an awful taste in your mouth .  luckily ,  this burger king can ease your troubles and is one of the best around from my experienced bk tour .  surely it is royalty ,  perhaps not the king ,  but the empress of fast food joints on this horrifying stretch of road .  a true diamond in the rough . 
__label__5 i ' ve been there often and have tried all they offer: brunch ,  lunch and dinner .  the selection is incredible and definitely has something for everyone .  the quality of the food is absolutely great !   salads are fresh and there ' s everything from veggies ,  fruit ,  fresh rolls ,  an array of pizzas and pastas ,  asian cuisine that ' s irresistible ,  sides galore ,  roast beef ,  roast turkey ,  ham ,  pork ,  plenty of offerings for vegetarians and vegans .  .  .  .  .  .  . and all of it is extraordinary .  the staff is friendly and professional ,  and none of it seems phony or lacking in any way .   with family ,  a date ,  or a just-for-me getaway ,  i head downtown and sit an enjoy  ( at my leisure )  some of the best food that ' s out there .  .  .  .  .  .  . oh ,  and did i mention ,  for a very affordable price  (  ?  )  .  .  .  especially when you compare it to large city dining ! 
__label__5 i ' ve called / texted / used tommy for rides to / from cle about 5x and he ' s always been prompt and accommodating .  no matter what time of day or night ,  he ' s been reliable .   his rates are fair .   i would def recommend him if you need a ride in cleveland . 
__label__5 if you are a fan of the christmas story this is a must see .   it ' s the home used in the filming of the movie ,  with restorations .   done very nice and while the leg lamp and the bb gun are not the originals from the movie  ( they were destroyed from my understanding )  they have replicas set up .   fun site to see and the gift shop has lots of really cute and funny things to pick up . 
__label__4 definitely a fun little stop ,  this is probably a 4 star place if you are a fan and a five star if you are a raving fanatic for the movie .  the tour was definitely worth the $10 and spending some time around the grounds and the gift shop are worth the hour you will kill . 
__label__4 if you live in the cleveland area or visit the area and like the christmas story ,  i would recommend a visit .   first off ,  if you can get street parking; just park on the street .   no need to pay to park in someone ' s yard .   the museum is free and they have different items in display with information you can read .   the gift shop is separate from the museum ,  so be sure not to miss it .   to your the house you have to pay $10 .   in case you are not aware; the movie was not filmed in the house - i think that is why some people are disappointed .   however ,  it is just a fun experience and it is only $10 .   and hey ,  if you do not want to spend the $10 ,  you can still walk around the outside ,  go to the museum and gift shop .   the question is - do you want to spend the money for then interactive experience inside the house ? 
__label__4 this place is a must if you have friends or family visiting from out of town ,  or if you are a giant pop culture nerd like myself .   we went on a saturday ,  and it was busy ,  but not overwhelmingly so .  i love that the house itself is interactive .  do you want to crawl under the sink and hide ,  because you ' re worried "daddy ' s gonna kill ralphie" ?  go for it .  sit at the table and read the newspaper ?  do that ,  too .   there are tons and tons of photo opportunities throughout the house .  i especially love that there are props  ( hats ,  bb guns ,  even the pink nightmare costume )  throughout ,  and you are encouraged to use them . 
__label__5 was a very cool house and part of clevelands history .  we went the day after christmas right when they opened and there was a long line but didn ' t feel like it .  this tour was self guided and hands on .  .  .  very fun ! 
__label__5 really cool place !  definitely worth the ride and money .  all the stuff in the gift store is very expensive .   our guide was very knowledgeable and the history was really cool .  especially being able to see the costumes and props that were actually in the movie .  take your camera ! 
__label__5 not too often do you get to walk down a true memory lane but upon our recent visit to cleveland we exactly had a chance to do this .  having an afternoon to wander about we found ourselves hailing a cab and a short two and a half miles from downtown we found it sitting there like an oasis in the middle of suburbia ,  usa ,  a christmas story house .   no snow but just the same it was a perfectly dark cold day with the leg lamp in the window acting like a beckoning beacon to all those on a journey to a childhood mecca .  it was perfect ,  young couples ,  old couples ,  groups of girls and families with kids running around shouting the immortal words , " you ' ll shoot your eye out ! "  the house itself was nicely refurbished with all the correct interior treasures .  downstairs in the living room along with the leg lamp in the window was the half open ,  straw filled "italian" fragile wooden crate and a half torn open "official red ryder carbine action 200 shot range model air rifle with a compass in the stock and this thing that tells time" tucked into one corner next to the desk .  upstairs had the lifebuoy soap bathroom complete with a decoder ring sitting on the hamper ,  the kitchen along with the sink ,  had the obligatory stove with a turkey sitting in the roasting pan waiting for the bumpass ' s dogs to make their appearance .  outside in the backyard was the little shed where the "icicle had broken off the eave and hit ralphie in the eye"   all in all worth the seven bucks ,  so if you liked the movie and if you ' re ever in the area ,  go visit ,  i triple dog dare ya '  ! 
__label__5 great !  street parking ,  no need to park in the "neighbor ' s " yard for a fee .  buy tickets at the store as they give you a timed ticket .  the staff was great .  they sat you down in the living room and gave  you the history and let you walk around the house and take pictures .   it ' s just a cute thing to do but it ' s not in a nice area so you ' ll want to go on the house tour ,  go to the store and the museum and leave .  i wouldn ' t think you would need more than  an hour or two .  i felt this place was very well run and professional .  our male tour guide was outstanding .  oh ,  and go in non peak season as i ' m guessing this place is crowded around the holidays . 
__label__5 the hubby and i are huge fans of the movie ,  and had to see this place !  there is a cute gift shop where you can purchase relatively reasonable souvenirs .  michelle ,  our tour guard was a riot ,  and very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the movie and the stories behind it .  we took a ton of photos ,  including one of rick with the major award ,  and me in the pink nightmare bunny suit .  there were all kinds of original props for the movie ,  and we had a blast ! 
__label__2 i hate to admit it ,  but i was disappointed with the place .   i mean ,  it was cool to see the house and play with a red rider bb gun and leg lamp ,  but i think the $10 per person admission price is too steep for what you get .   there was a long line  ( being christmas season and all )  and because of that ,  there were no guided tours .   instead ,  you were sort of funnled / rushed through the house and encouraged to "read the brochure if you want information about the house"  i ' m sure the experience is better when guided tours are available ,  so my advice is to try it out then .   the museum portion was small ,  and most of the items on display were not originals or were obscure pieces .   i expected to see something like the original leg lamp or a bunny suit .   instead it was photocopies of original scripts and letters and obscure costume pieces .   actors with bit parts in the movie  ( the guy who delivered the leg lamp and the elf from the department store )  were at the museum to give brief bits of info and sign purchased merchandise .     parking in the area ,  especially when it is crowded ,  is sort of a nightmare .   narrow streets are fully parked up so we gave in and paid the neighbor $15 to park .     it isn ' t that i didn ' t have a good time ,  i just feel that the ticket price should be more like $5 and they should work on improving the quality of the museum ' s exhibits . 
__label__4 we went to alaturka last night for the first time .  it was wonderful !  our waitor ,  michael ,  was very gracious ,  knowledgeable ,  and attentive .  the food was authentic ,  fresh and flavourful !   the value was excellent .  we enjoyed the company of the owners ,  who sat at the bar next to us and were very hospitable and friendly .  the only downside was the drab decor .  the lights were bright and the music was barely audible .  there were no textures or colors .  very un-turkish !  that ' s why i did not give 5 stars . 
__label__3 i have been riding rta on and off since i was in kindergarten .   i have ridden the bus ,  the rapid ,  and the trolleys downtown .   most of the time ,  they are on time .   i can rely on the bus each day on my way to work .   the bus is very bumpy ,  noisy ,  and sometimes smelly ,  but it works and is usually the shortest route to my work .   the train takes longer because i have to drive to get to it .  the trains offer a smoother ride ,  more room ,  more comfort ,  but are much more prone to break downs than the bus due to their age .   the trains were built in the mid 1970 ' s !   they require ongoing maintenance and really need to be replaced .   but trains are expensive ,  so no new trains !   the bus is warm and the drivers have been friendly to me .   i just wish i could get an express bus to downtown .   i ' ll keep riding because my company pays for my bus fare . 
__label__5 seattle is currenlty building a mass-transit simular to what cleveland already has - the rta .     i was thrilled to be able to hop on a train at the airport and take it all the way downtown .   the stations seemed clean ,  safe ,  and free of the usual suspects .     the cost is right ,  too !   $1 . 75 from the airport to my hotel in public square and it only takes 25 minutes !   wooo ! 
__label__3 more people should use the rta .   hopefully folks will wise up as the price of gas sky rockets .   the trains are relatively clean ,  quiet ,  not loaded with nutjobs .   i ' ve seen  ( and smelled )  a lot worse in chicago .    i wonder how profitable the rta is ?   there was barely anyone on the red line on a saturday afternoon .    the view is pretty cool along the red line route .   really sweet graffiti to check out too .    they need to get rid of that lite rock bs they play in the tower city station though .   makes me wanna slit my wrists . 
__label__2 was visiting from boston and had to hunt down a dunkin donuts around the cleveland area .  .  ended up needing some auto repairs done at a dealership that was close by and found this dd !  well it wasn ' t all that bad and i had to tell the person making my coffee how to make it 3 times .  .  .  totally different than the dunkins we have in boston .  .  .  .  .  . 
__label__2 my boyfriend and i went to brooklyn new today because of the reviews on yelp .  i gave it 3 stars because hey people were very friendly but the food was not all that good .  my boyfriend and i had both gotten the pulled pork sandwiches the bread was so soggy we could even hold it thankfully we had he exact same buns and just transferred all the meat .  i think there could of been a more sauce and we also got fries they were your try picas fries no taste or salt .  it ' s okay but i wouldn ' t go back i can make better pulled pork at home
__label__4 this is where you come for some real bbq like we do it down south .  the cole slaw is right on target too .  i ' m betting the rest of their soul food is great as well .    important side note - this is not a dine-in restaurant .  they do pickup and i think delivery .  that ' s why i can ' t give it 5 stars - not really inexpensive enough for me to overlook that .    despite this ,  i absolutely recommend brooklyn bbq for anyone looking for genuine charcoal-cooked bbq and soul food .  it ' s the real deal . 
__label__5 great food all around best bbq restaurant in area  .  try the rib tips there awesome and the sauce is to die for
__label__4 great sauce !  soft rib meat .  even the coleslaw was tasty .  we opted for delivery and it was pretty quick too . 
__label__5 ben ' s is an asset to cleveland and the body shop industry .  i would definitely recommend ben ' s for any autobody repair work .   i was towed to ben ' s on a aaa recommendation and was impressed .  a warm family business ,  ben ' s provides one of the best customer service experiences in cleveland .  i must have visited the shop at least three times during the repair and each time i was given a thorough update on my lexus in addition to the updates available online .  ben could tell i was very worried about gaps ,  paint color and the custom pin stripe matching up .  much to my surprise ,  based on experiences with other cars and body shops ,  the color matched up perfectly ,  the gaps look factory and the pinstripe was pretty much spot on . 
__label__3 came here for bastille concert .  concert was amazing .   it was pitch black in there when we first walked in and the the security there had lights but didn ' t shine them so people could make it up the stairs which was odd .   it was like 100 degrees in there .   i don ' t know if the air was off or what but it made for a humid sticky sweaty experience .  other than those things ,  the place wasn ' t too shabby . 
__label__1 horrible  ,  unsafe venue where people go to get drunk instead of listen to music .  limit alcohol sales there !  parking is the best thing about this venue . 
__label__3 i would probably give flannery ' s a 3 1 / 2 if i could .  the food was mediocre ,  the service was excellent ,  and their beer selection is good ,  but too pricey for what it is .  i ' ll likely return since it ' s in walking distance . 
__label__2 we were visiting cleveland and initially had a hard time finding anything open .   when we found this place it was .  .  .  fine .     we each had two good beers ,  served cold with minimum interaction from the bartender .   we also ordered the prime rib skewers .   the were tasty and the horseradish cream sauce that they came with was quite good ,  but not remarkable .   we were just underwhelmed by the entire experience .    i am sure that this is a place that has plenty of regulars and if we lived nearby it might become a place that we would visit frequently ,  but for this trip ,  it was just a good place to waste an hour . 
__label__4 i enjoy this place for lunch more than dinner .  this is a quick stop for lunch during work and the food is great .  the dinner menu and beer prices seem pricey for the competition around i . e .  harry buffalo ,  corner alley .  overall ,  this place has great food ,  consistant service ,  and there is hardly ever a wait . 
__label__5 jen stabbed me in the ass with the fat head tap handle .  if you like getting stabbed in the ass flannery ' s is the place to be ,  just ask for brad !  !  love you jen . 
__label__4 i have been going to flannery ' s pub for about 20 years ,  at least .  i have gone for lunch ,  dinner ,  late night snacks and for good ,  old fashioned drink-ups .  i have also spent many st .  patrick ' s day ' s at flannery ' s .    the bar staff are very friendly and pour a nice pint of guinness .  they also make really good  ( by good ,  i mean strong )  mixed drinks .  of ,  course they also have many options for beer on tap .    the food menu offers many options from soups / salads ,  to wraps and sandwiches .  they also have more traditional irish food entrees and american fare .  as a vegetarian ,  i never worry at flannery ' s .  the chef ,  willie ,  is always willing to alter a recipe to accommodate what i am in the mood for .    flannery ' s is a nice size pub .  they have a nice big bar area ,  an area for live mi sic ,  and plenty of tables .  i have been a part of very large parties at flannery ' s and they were able to serve us all with ease . 
__label__3 it was late ,  and there was much drinking .   after catching a show at hob ,  i hobbled / stumbled down the street to lounge on the patio with a beer  ( with the band )  .     everything was perfectly nice and servicable ,  from what i remember ,  but nothing stands out as exactly memorable .  .  . um ,  not that the many beers have anything to do with it .   uh ,  huh . 
__label__3 stopped by right before an indians '  game for a quick bite to eat and a  ' snakebite '  that hit just the right spot .    my parents were also along for the meal and we found all dishes met our palate .    my favorite thing though is they really know how to make a  ' snakebite '  !   perfect blend of beer and hard cider .   brings me back to my days of traveling through germany and the is favorite irish watering hole in stuttgart . 
__label__2 if you ' re just looking for a bar to chill and hang out with your friends ,  this is a great place .  if you ' re looking for decent service and delicious food ,  try again .    this place is slightly overpriced for their food and the food is mediocre .  maybe a little tastier than most bars in cleveland ,  but this is a bar located on east 4th so i kind of had high expectations .  if you are a bar on east 4th ,  you should make sure to have great service and great food ,  and flannery ' s had neither .    i ordered their shrimp appetizer and my friends had some fish & chips .  honestly ,  i liked their food ,  it just wasn ' t as delicious as a lot of other bars i ' ve been trying in cleveland .    come for a fun night of drinks ,  but probably not for gourmet food . 
__label__5 awesome time watching the game even though the cavs lost .  jen ,  our server was awesome !  !  kept our glasses full and handled the crowd with ease !  cavs ,  not so great ,  but flannery ' s made our night ! 
__label__4 authentic irish cuisine with a great environment .  decor was excellent as well as cle sports on every wall !  shepherds pie was excellent and worth a try if you ' re down on 4th .  draft selections were awesome !  4 stars !  ! 
__label__4 downtown cleveland ,  irish pub that was hoping for st patty ' s day .   its at the top of bar alley that has a fun decor and i nice food menu ! 
__label__3 we headed west and found our way to 4th street .  this was more of a pedestrian street with several restaurants to choose from .  we walked to the end of the thoroughfare and decided on an irish pub called flannery ' s .   at flannery ' s ,  we were seated outside on the patio because it was a pleasantly breezy 70 degrees out .  we were also within view of the quicken loans arena where labron james kills it on a daily basis during basketball season ,  but back to the meal .  i went with the meat loaf ,  which was actually an impulse order .  it was also fantastic .  the loaf looked like it was baked ,  then sliced and sautied with a nice little crunch on the outside .  did i mention that it was wrapped in bacon ?  the gravy on the loaf had a good amount of spice to it and the mashed potatoes were standard .  i ordered a burning river pale ale with the meal .  since it was a cleveland brewing company ,  i decided to give this local brew a try .  it was an ok ale .  the bitter aftertaste was not very subtle and was ultimately the downfall to what could have been a good beer . 
__label__4 best chinese in the westpark area .  good portion of meat and yummy lo mein .  the spicy items really aren ' t that spicy though so i always all for them to be extra spicy . 
__label__1 the absolute worst .    i have never been treated so rudely and brashly before at an area meant for tourists .    my boyfriend and i decided to visit this museum since it was for free and with it ' s really high score .  less than five minutes into entering ,  i was fumbling around my purse to take out my phone to take a photo of one of the statues and there was a packaged ,  sealed snack in my bag that shifted around .    immediately some portly ,  mustachioed caucasian security guard huffed and puffed his way towards us and said ,  "no food in the gallery" .  we explained to him that we were not eating it and that we just wanted to take a photo and that the food was sealed .    my boyfriend and i turned around to go back to the statue ,  but lo and behold this man was right behind us and yelled ,  "get out of the gallery" .    i was utterly shocked and appalled at the lack of courtesy and common decency that this man employee had .  there was no "i ' m sorry .  . " ,  "please" ,  or "excuse me" .    for a place that is meant for tourists and visitors this form of treatment and behavior was completely unacceptable .    i will never visit this museum again and i will advise my friends and family from doing so as well . 
__label__4 i thought this place was great .  don ' t quite understand some of the really bad reviews .  don ' t go to a thrift store expecting saks !  it ' s in an old strip mall like so many of these type places but it is generally clean and well organized .  it is large with a good selection of everything from furniture to clothing .  prices are very reasonable .  they do have a section of items that they consider higher value ,  and the prices reflect that .  you might not agree with the value assigned but that is the nature of thrifting . 
__label__1 i ' ve sat in the drive through line for so long that i ' ve come to my senses that i don ' t even want to put this filth in my body .  so i got to the window and was going just suck it up and get my stupid quesorito but .  .  .  they didn ' t have meat !  !  !  i just said forget it and drove off like i robbed the place .  waste of 20 minutes of my life .  got a salad from dina ' s across the street  . 
__label__1 went to go through the drive thru at 9 on a friday night and it was closed .  walked inside and waited for at least 25 minutes for 3 tacos .  the cashier was on her phone almost the entire time while taking customer orders . 
__label__4 we were craving some ethiopian and in cleveland is difficult to find ,  so we were glad to learn that zoma opened a month ago or so .  we read the reviews before going and were a bit scared by the comments on service ,  but we had a free evening and decided to try anyway .  well ,  i guess they improved a lot on service: we were immediately seated even though the place was crowded ,  ordered immediately and the food came in 15 minutes .  we ordered sambusas and the meat /  veggie combo ,  asked for a substitution  ( an extra veggie entree instead of the spicy beef )  and they accommodated us with no issues .  the food was very good ,  the mild beef stew very tasty ,  and all the veggies were spiced but not too much ,  delicious .  the only very small complain: we had the combo to feed two people ,  and while the food is definitely enough for one ,  it might be not enough for two .  a little more generous portions of veggies would have helped ,  but i also have to say that the owner  ( a very kind person )  asked me what i liked most and when i mentioned the stew ,  he brought some more at the table  ( without me asking or complaining about anything )  .  the ambient is casual and relaxed ,  and there is a byob with 7$ corkage fee .  we will definitely come back and try some more food ! 
__label__4 good service !  even though me and a couple of coworkers came here late .  the bartenders were friendly and told us what was the chill spots in town . 
__label__2 our server was very friendly !  the sound system an tv ' s are on the same circuit .  which they decided to work on while we were in the restaurant .  my chorizo app and chicken sandwich was dry !   the bright spot was the fresh cut fries .  for average  ( at best )  bar food ,  the price was a bit over priced  (  by about $1 . 50 per dish )  .   nice beer selection . 
__label__3 they do a nice job most of the time ,  but not always .  there is a lot of turnover so you can ' t always see the same person   they offer gel polish and regular here .  manicures ,  pedicures ,  acrylic nails and fills .  etc .    the people are pleasant- but not overly nice   i am a regular here - because it ' s close to my home
__label__5 this guy killed it at the b-side yesterday .  he ' s got some bitchin '  taste in house ,  bass ,  and techno--really got his ear to the ground for the freshest tunes from london--and has an even better sense for what the crowd needs when .  slick transitions ,  tunes for everyone without alienating anyone .  just hours of solid dance .   seriously ,  this guy kills . 
__label__1 i would stay away from this location .  i went here ordered dine in the food was typical for what you would expect .  my issue came when i attempted to submit payment using a pizza hut e gift card .  i was told by the manager maurice that i couldn ' t use it there because this location was a corporate location  (  keep in mind that i have used e gift cards with maurice at this location before )  i can tell by the suspicious look he gave the card when i submitted it to him something was up .  maurice even claimed to have attempted to use card and it was rejected .  .  . i watched him he made no attempt .  so i called corporate and was told that the e gift cards were usable at all pizza huts .  i then asked maurice for his bosses name and number to which he replied that he couldn ' t give out her number .  so i left all of my contact info for her to call me .  i finally receive a follow up call  ( was told she called me back because i called corp not because maurice told her to call me like i requested )  to which i was told that only franchise locations accept e gift cards .  to which i replied how are customers supposed to discern between corp and franchise locations and why would you put that determination on customers ?  i didn ' t get as much as an apology for the embarrassment this situation caused me from maurice the manager or kate the district manager .  kate also thought i was some other customer that tried to use a e gift card and they accepted theirs as a courtesy but i wasn ' t afforded the same .  kate also stated that they don ' t accept e cards yet maurice claimed to have tried to enter it but couldn ' t  ( this card is a pizza hut product )  funny thing i gave the e card to a friend and he used it via the net for delivery with no problem .  i even called corp back once more and requested for someone else to call me .  .  .  . no one bothered .  .  . 
__label__3 i feel like we got cheated somehow .  i ' ve been reading such great reviews of this place and been waiting to come here forever ,  but it was a real let down .   don ' t get me wrong ,  the place is beautiful and i just love the fact that you are in small dining rooms of the inn .  its cozy and sweet .  the food really fell short though .   we started with the poached pear salad ,  which could have been great but was so salty .  i literally could not choke down more than a bite or two .   i thought maybe some rookie in the kitchen accidentally dropped the entire sea salt shake on our salad before bringing it out ,  but the bf didn ' t mind it ,  so i guess maybe its more of a preference thing than a real mess up .  i honestly found it completely inedible though .   for entrees ,  we ordered the mack and cheese and the veal shortribs .   both were pretty plain and i am sure i have made similar things at home .   nothing on their menu screams creativity ,  they are all solid classics ,  which is not a bad thing but then i do expect them to be done really well .   it just wasn ' t the case though ,  and so if i come back in the future it will likely only be for their $40 date deal  ( which sounds great btw )  or happy hour . 
__label__5 5 stars for sure !  so good !  beautiful atmosphere !  great food !  and not overpriced .  we got the beet salad ,  mussels without the the chorizo ,  and the shrimp scampi as the dish for me !  would come here again and try other things for sure . 
__label__4 history:  washington place bistro & inn is a surprisingly sturdy replacement to the historic baricelli inn ,  which was a cleveland landmark for over 25 years .  and though baricelli inn closed up shop in july 2010 ,  the barcelli name lives on at washington place - the new restaurant features baricelli cheese  ( winner !  )   washington place bistro & inn still operates the "inn" portion ,  with 7 rooms available for an overnight getaway .  i didn ' t check the rooms out but their website lists rack rate at $139  /  night .   service: the quickest way to win my heart at a new restaurant is prompt and attentive service .  washington place knocked it out of the park !  i arrived about 20 minutes before my dining companion  ( which literally never happens )  and the server immediately offered a cocktail list and recommended a few personal favorites .  throughout dinner service  ( we had 3-courses )  ,  flatware was refreshed ,  drinks refilled ,  courses recommended .  the manager came out to say hello to dinners in our space .    food:  1st course:  roasted cauliflower bisque: [ crumbled blue cheese  ,  balsamic gastrique] :: 3 . 5 out of 5 ::  the soup had good texture but i was expecting a stronger flavor .  the bleu cheese added some saltiness and depth .  balsamic did not do much .     2nd course:  mack & cheese [ mackenzie and baricelli cheeses ,  local chorizo ,  goat cheese strudel ,  micro greens ] ::4 . 5 out of 5 :: get this .  noodle used is pasta al ceppo ,  a personal favorite .   cheese blend ,  perfectly salty and creamy .  chorizo ,  pieces were sized to stand up next to noodles ,  flavor was spicy with sweet cinnamon flavor at the end .  goat cheese strudel was a placed atop and i wish i dug into this first .  yum .   an ounce more of greens to cleanse your palate a bit from all the richness would make it perfect .     dessert: presti ' s glazed donut bread pudding with jeni ' s ugandan vanilla bean ice cream .  :: 5 out of 5 :: if this isn ' t a staple dessert ,  it needs to be immediately .  the dessert is made to order so it came out warm and smelling to heaven of glazed ,  cinnamon .  the jeni ' s vanilla has enough flavor compliment the sugary dough  ( boring vanilla makes me sad )  .     i ' ll be back soon . 
__label__5 i adore this place .   ive been here several times and never had a bad meal .   wednesdays they have a special with a bottle of wine 2 entrees and appetizer for 40$ .   the food and service quality as well as the atmosphere is excellent .  brunch is wonderful here also .   they had these incredible sweet rolls on sunday mornings .   i could dine here happily every week . 
__label__4 had about an hour to kill while i waited on the lady so i decided to pop up yelp as usual and locate a good grub spot that also had a bar and bam found washington place bistro .   i drove by and it looked cool and had a sweet feel to the outside with lighting and free valet parking so that worked out perfectly .  walked in and pulled up a seat at the bar ,  the bartender was real cool ,  and told him i ' m not from around here and he took care of me with a menu and what i should get .  also told him about gluten allergies and he was well compsoed in his knowledge of the menu so i chose the chicken with risotto which was amazing ,  tasty ,  rich ,  and the chicken was moist and perfect compliments to the risotto .    for drinks i first got the whiskey flight which showcased different whiskeys and it came with a dish of 4 different compliments to each whiskey which was pretty elite if you ask me .  they were mouth wash strong but tasty ,  had to switch it up so i got a moscow mule which was perfectly balanced and had great ginger beer .  great service ,  great food ,  i ' d come back for the chicken dish alone . 
__label__5 ambiance:  4 .   let me start by saying i never frequented the old barcelli inn at this location .  that said ,  loved the modern but cozy plantation-like feel .   open air kitchen you walk by on the way to tables is a nice touch ,  especially reassuring for those of us that have seen the movie waiting .   one note -- there ' s various rooms so if you like a certain dining experience  you need to call ahead and ask for that  ( quiet ,  outside ,  larger room ,  etc .  )  .   however ,  the distance from main drag of little italy and area surrounding it leaves something to be desired ,  and would be the likely reason i don ' t return on a regular basis .   cost:  4 .  most appetizers were slightly pricey in my opinion ,  but portions were generous .   as far as meals go typical mid to high end restaurant with ~$20 meals but a little higher after including sides  and / or salad .   food quality: 5 .  local sourcing ,  good variety but not too many items that you think they ' re just using a all encompassing cookbook .   appetizers outshined the main meal slightly  ( calamari featured very light and fluffy breading ,  while the shrimp and grits was also something special )  ,  but still i enjoyed the perch & lobster cake special i had .   another in our party commented the mahi mahi was outstanding .   service: 5 .  waitress was great ,  bus staff excellent as well -- constant water refills  ( a key myself )  and did not rush to take our plates away .   oh ,  and the waitress actually knew something about menu when we asked questions .   when to return:  any and all .  great for happy hour ,  summer time  ( great patio )  ,  special occasions  ( secluded rooms )  and dates . 
__label__3 i admit ,  the food was very good .  there was a loud table near us ,  but that ' s not the restaurant ' s fault .  however ,  my primary complaint is with regard to the price .  the prices were not ridiculous ,  and based on the atmosphere ,  which is very nice and high-end looking ,  i thought the prices might be reasonable .  the problem is that ,  based on the prices ,  they would have to either 1 )  have amazingly good food ,  or 2 )  have bigger portions .   again ,  the food was good ,  but the servings are quite small ,  so you have to be content going home to have dinner #2 or you have to get additional courses ,  which makes it even more expensive .  great place ,  just not sure the pricing is quite reasonable .   haven ' t stayed there ,  but the inn looks beautiful ,  and the service and atmosphere were quite nice . 
__label__4 i ' ve been here for thursday happy hour  ( $6 burger and fries with the purchase of a full-priced drink )  ,  sunday brunch ,  and their $40 for 2 wednesday deal .  really great value for their specials .  their burgers are juicy and well-cooked ,  with a nice toasted bun and crispy fries .  shrimp and grits and their pot roast mash for sunday brunch is very tasty  ( and a little on the heavier side )  .  complimentary monkey bread ,  which was also sweet ,  warm ,  gooey ,  and delicious .  the $40 for 2 wednesday deal is an unbeatable value .  two entrees  ( from a limited menu )  ,  one appetizer ,  and a bottle of wine .  awesome date night idea ,  especially outside on the patio during the summer .    my only minor complaint is their limited menu .  what they do ,  they do well ,  but it would be nice to change it up once in a while .  also a smaller venue ,  which is quieter and intimate ,  but less able to accommodate larger parties at certain times . 
__label__4 i would eat every single thing on the menu it ' s that delicious .  i don ' t like salmon and would even try it here because the food is that kind of good .  the mac and cheese is the best i ' ve ever had and i ' ve never scraped the bottom of a plate of mac and cheese before !  the cheese board was outstanding .  the honey paired with the cheeses was even better than what gets served at mario battali ' s eataly !  everything was so good we came back for brunch - it wasn ' t as spectacular as dinner but still yummy .  highly recommend this place and so surprised that it ' s never packed . 
__label__1 i am very disappointed in this restaurant because after making a reservation several weeks ago with a note regarding handicapped accessibility ,  no one contacted me until the morning of my reservation ,  in which they then informed me that the restaurant had stairs and no ramp .  i had seven people in my reservation and was highly inconvenienced .  will not come here in the future .  i
__label__4 walk-up counter in the galleria food court .    haven ' t tried the baked goods ,  but the sandwiches are first rate .    their egg salad on rye was wonderful . 
__label__2 food is good .   service could be vastly improved .   they have no bathroom for the customers to use  ( which i think is against the law for a restaurant )  .   i complained to subway corporate ,  but never heard back from them .   actually they do have a bathroom .   the conversation went like this: me: can i use the bathroom ?  afr am sandwich artist: yes ,  it ' s thru that door anglo sandwich artist: no ,  you can ' t .   we had a customer steal a purse from there ,  so no one is allowed to use it anymore me: take the purses out ,  besides i ' m not going to steal anything anglo sa: no ,  we don ' t allow customers to use it anymore  anyway ,  the sandwich was good
__label__5 it is nice that ccf has a few shops inside so folks visiting or staying have options to shop a little or kill time browsing .  glad they sold phone chargers ,  they got eve
__label__5 this was my first escape experience .   we had a group of 10 and were successful in escaping the meltdown in the steel mill .    we had a great time and our group consisted of adults from 27-70 .   this is a well  kept secret in southeast cleveland .   fun time ! 
__label__5 staff was very friendly and welcoming .  the atmosphere was nice and clean ,   and got you in the detective mood right away with the decor and furniture .  my girlfriend and i enjoyed gameplay despite it being quite challenging .  our game master was excellent at giving us clues without giving away the whole game .  refreshments were offered afterward .  overall i am very impressed with the whole experience .  escape hunt is a must-do !  !  ! 
__label__3 i ' m a big fan of fro-yo ,  and i have to say i wasn ' t all that impressed with menchie ' s .  seemed like a yogurt vi mixed with a pinkberry mixed with any other yogurt chain .  kudos to the very friendly greeter who explained how the menchie ' s system works .    i tried a couple of the flavors and should have gotten dulce de leche .  instead ,  i got original tart .  it was pretty "meh" in my opinion .  the best part of my yogurt ?  the fruit i put on top .  the yogurt itself was yellowish and didn ' t taste all that great .  but .  .  . it was worth trying .    since this yogurt shop is within bicycling distance of my house ,  i ' m sure i ' ll be back .  i just won ' t get original tart ! 
__label__4 fun place .  good yogurt .  i like that i can pick from any topping .  .  .  and they have so many to choose from !  it ' s a fun place .  everyone was nice .  we ' ll be back ! 
__label__4 had lunch here on a friday afternoon .  sat inside however you can sit outside as well .  service was really fast and friendly .  had the garlic burger which was phenomenal .  my niece had the fish and chips which she loved .  other family members had sandwiches and salads and everything was delicious and the portion size was decent  ( you could definitely split a sandwich )  . 
__label__3 no shock top ,  out of samuel smiths completely ,  and get this ,  no great lakes dortmunders !   hello ,  we ' re in cleveland !  place is really going downhill man .  .  . 
__label__2 place is in steady decline .   menus are tattered .   same beers they have had since the 90s and employees are ghetto ,  except for bartenders .   i just bought 1 beer ,  handed her a 10 and was asked if i wanted change .   does she tip 4 . 00 on one draft beer ?   bet not .   place sucks .  .  . 
__label__3 this is another "american irish" bar .  this does not resemble a traditional irish pub ,  and the food isn ' t authentic either ,  for example: shepherd ' s pie is made with ground lamb not beef .  and since when has chicken marsala been a traditional irish dish ?  i know i ' m being picky but still .  .  .  i opted for the fish and chips ,  and was disappointed with the quality of the fish and the over-cooked fries ,  not chips .  the reuben was "just ok . " the service was good ,  and the place had a nice atmosphere .  extensive beer list too . 
__label__5 went here for lunch wednesday .  the place was clean and the staff was great .  i ordered the chicken fingers and fries off the lunch menu and my friend got the mac n cheese .  my chicken fingers and fries were amazing !  i would actually go here just to eat their fries .  they basically cut a potato into slices and deep fry them .  i think they make them per order as well .  they ' re so good .  my friends noodles were cooked perfect .  and he said the sauce was great and tasted homemade and not a yellow packet .  the food came out really quick .  we get an hour lunch and we had to walk here and walk back .  we actually had 15 minutes to spare so we just sat and talked .  the booths aren ' t very fluffy people friendly so best to get a table .  there weren ' t many options for the lunch menu .  their menu is available online so check them out before you go .  they are a bit pricey but worth it !  can ' t wait to go back and get those fries again ! 
__label__3 stopped in between a visit to the rock n roll hof and a movie .   good food & atmosphere for myself and three college students  ( my son and friends )  .   the "kids" played pool while waiting for our food and had a generally good time .   one miscue .  .  . the appetizers and meals arrived more or less together . 
__label__4 nice and slow sunday evening with my family i ordered the fish and chips traditional think hunk of cod with guinness batter .  our waiter tim was areal nice dude who took good care of us .  .  my son gave 8 of 10 stars for the spicy garlic wings ,  wife had a delicious cranberry walnut  salad and daughter # 2 had the turkey club that was "good" .   this will earn a return visit when we head back to the  big c . 
__label__2 `buyer beware !  !  !   this company is a rip-off !   you have to buy product and can not open to see if product is what you are looking for !   i just purchased plates and napkins for party for $19 . 99 each .   opened to look at plate and napkin  ( very low quality )  put back into package and returned .   not only did we have to pay shipping ,  we received half credit of $9 . 99 and had to pay shipping !  !   so beware if you want to use this company .  .  . just know you will have to spend some $$ to just see if it is what you want !   very poor customer service !   will never use again .  .  . will never recommend !  !  ! 
__label__1 mediocre food at high prices .  i would suggest avoiding this place .  i ordered a spinach and four cheese pizza ,  and was horrified to receive a pita crust with frozen spinach and shredded "mozzarella" cheese .  the pizza was barely warm .    my husband ordered the monk fish dish .  he enjoyed it but it was not impressed for the price .    we gave the homemade tiramisu a try .  we must be gluttons for punishment because we should have left it at the cold ,  overpriced pizza .  the tiramisu was below subpar .  it was dry and flavorless .  very disappointing .    a door knob would have been friendlier than the server .  she was not interested in being there or serving us .    we will not be back to la dolce vita and urge you not to waste your time and / or money . 
__label__1 a gallon jar of minced garlic does not an italian restaurant make .  how this shithole survives on the best corner in little italy must be credited to a name that ends with a vowel .  i ' m a cleveland italian .  this place can fuck itself . 
__label__1 terrible service ,  from the hostess to the servers ,  and mediocre food . 
__label__4 great atmosphere and the staff was very helpful and provided recommendations that were spot on !  pasta is great as well as their pizza .  the owner personally comes out and chats with patrons which adds to an authentic italian eatery ambiance . 
__label__4 this was the highlight of our trip to cleveland and it is well worth the trip out of downtown .  we visited during winter with about a foot of snow on the ground so it really set the stage .  it is like stepping into the movie .  the tour staff was very knowledgeable and the gift shop was well stocked with interesting merchandise . 
__label__3 kitschy and a little silly ,  but not a bad "tourist trap" for $5 per person on groupon .   i found it odd that there are three different locations: the house ,  the museum ,  and the gift shop .   all located on the same street ,  within walking distance .   it was cold the day we went and it was very crowded ,  even though christmas was weeks ago .   we all huddled on the front porch ,  waiting for the first tour of the day .   the staff was very friendly and very passionate about the movie ,  so thumbs up to them !   i enjoyed hearing our tour guide- she was delightful .   very friendly ,  helpful ,  and knowledgeable .   everything in the house is "interactive" .   you can pick things up ,  take photos ,  look into rooms at your leisure ,  etc .  the museum across the street was a little lack-luster .   i would recommend they consolidate and move that over to the basement of the house or something .   the actor who delivered the fragile package was there that day ,  signing copies of a "behind-the-scenes" dvd they were selling .   although he had a small role ,  he was very passionate about the iconic movie and fragilee '  package .   the gift shop was a bit over-priced ,  but i found myself buying a "leg lamp" magnet and a couple over-priced post cards .  although i ' m glad i went ,  i doubt i ' d go again .   been there ,  done that . 
__label__3 the house itself is accurate ,  but the neighborhood is nothing like the movie  ( 2 doors down ,  the owner has converted his front yard into a parking lot ,  capitalizing on the limited on-street parking )  .   take a look at google ' s street view .   i ' ve been a fan of jean shepherd since listening to his radio shows in the 1970 ' s ,  so i ' m glad i made the visit ,  but for $12 a person ,  the tour isn ' t cheap  ( and let ' s face-it ,  it ' s nothing more than an old house )  . 
__label__4 we took the trip down the ohio turnpike and went to visit this house and museum of which of course is in the famous movie that which is played for 24 hours on tbs every christmas eve .       we arrived today at 12:15 pm and the first tour starts at 12:30 .   we walked around the outside of the house after we purchased our tickets at the gift shop across the street .   the gift shop itself is quaint but offers all of the christmas story memorabilia you could want .   we shopped but didn ' t purchase as the prices are a bit high .   nice to walk around and look at the different items you could buy though .        now the tour .   our guide walk us into the house and gave an approx .  15 minute talk on the history of the house and how most of the movie  ( 80% )  was actually shot in canada on a sound stage .   this kind of took away from the experience but nevertheless it was neat .   we took photos of the inside and outside .   of course we got a shot of the infamous "leg lamp" along with the other nostalgic items that were in the house .  the down side of the visit was the time constraints .   after the fifteen minute speech ,  we were allowed to walk around the house but for only fifteen minutes as the next tour began .   with the amount of people taking photos ,  us included ,  15 minutes was not enough time .   we hurried but still got the photos we wanted .        we completed our visit by walking across the street to the museum .   it too is small but contains actual props that were used in the movie .   you could take pictures but without flash and no recordings either .   it was a pleasant visit overall and the kids enjoyed it too .   although ,  they did become antsy listening to the tour guide talk but otherwise they had fun . 
__label__4 awesome !   it was later in the afternoon when we arrived so we did not take the tour of the house .   however ,  there are plenty of photo ops to be had on the outside of the house and in the free ,  yet super small ,  museum .   if you are looking for souvenirs and trinkets ,  be sure to check out the gift shop across the street !   you can purchase an infamous leg lamp in a variety of sizes ,  tshirts ,  holiday ornaments ,  glassware .  .  . just about anything your heart desires .   the museum includes a few clothing items from the movie as well as movie posters from spain and france ,  original pillars from the homes front porch ,  and various toys and trinkets from the home that made it into various scenes in the movie .   as far as parking ,  you might get lucky and find a spot in the street or you can pay $5 to park in various neighbors '  yards .   tours of the house appear to take place every 30 minutes .   i feel completely satisfied with the experience we had even though we did not take the tour .   totally worth the $5 to park ! 
__label__4 a fun attraction in cleveland .  the tour is s little pricey but worth it if you want to see the inside of the house .  our favorite part of the tour was the fun facts and trivia from the movie ,  things we will definitely have to watch for next time we watch the movie at christmas .  staff was very friendly .  this was the best part of our day . 
__label__5 i can ' t see why anyone would hate this place .  if you do ,  i ' m sorry that your childhood was so terrible that you couldn ' t enjoy this place .    sure ,  only the exterior of the house was used for the movie ,  but that still means the movie was filmed here .  and the guy who bought it has restored it to be a carbon copy of what it looked like in the movie .  such an awesome job done by the guy . 
__label__4 has wonderful corned beef hash .   it ' s the only thing i would recommend there though .  first come first serve .   no reservations . 
__label__3 solid food at a decent price .  i will come back here .  looks like they are in the middle of a renovation .  this a cute part of town and this place is right in the middle of the action .  they have been around for a while and will continue to be .  sausage gravy and biscuits are the thing here .  i will try the corned beef hash next time .  recommend it . 
__label__3 while working in the area big al ' s was strongly recommended to me and my coworkers .  it is a very small diner .  after entering you ' re not sure wether you seat yourself or be seated .  we were directed by the waitress across the room to seat ourselves .  this is your typical diner with a variety of comfort food menu items .  i got the reuben and fries ,  one coworker ordered an omelet ,  the other a fried fish sandwich .  all of our meal portions were a decent size .  i was very pleased with the taste of my sandwich .  the coworker who ordered the fish was not ,  she said it was a tasteless minced fish fillet straight out the freezer .  the omelette was a winner too ,  pretty large with fresh ingredients .  the service was fairly fast but not the friendliest  waitress .  no drink refills and no checking up on our meals .  my sandwich and fries came to around $9 ,  not too bad for the amount of food .  would i come back ,  probably ,  is it one of my more memorable diner experiences ,  no .  i ' ll probably try a breakfast item next time . 
__label__4 i like this place .   it is a diner ,  not a restaurant .   there is a difference .   there are no tablecloths .   limited breakfast and lunch menu ,  comfort food served up fresh and hot in large portions reasonably priced .   omelets were huge with generous amounts of the added veggies and meats .   the signature corned beef hash lives up to the hype .   the ambiance is the essence of life in the cle - diversity at its best .   parking can be a challenge .   although the parking lot seems adequate for the size of the dining room ,  it gets full easily .   overall ,  worth a trip for an outstanding classic breakfast . 
__label__1 i had high hopes when we found such a charming diner near our new home ,  and we came several times .  the food was forest and the prices were alright ,  but the service is consistently terrible .   the drawback of having customers seat themselves is that often we went completely unnoticed ,  and this last time we waited 20 minutes ,  during which we were visited by a server twice to check in on us ,  and told we would be gotten to shortly .   it was disheartening to say the least ,  as i had planned to continue coming even with the long wait ,  but that level of disorganization and customer neglect will not warrant another visit . 
__label__5 best damn breakfast in cleveland !  i moved to los angeles and its what i miss most about cleveland !  !  !  ! 
__label__3 i love macarons ,  and will order one at any place that makes them ,  so i was excited to try this new shop at university circle .  it ' s a beautifully presented little space with a classy vibe .  unfortunately ,  i have to agree with reviewer yuan c .  -- the macarons left me feeling "meh . " they ' re perhaps too subtle in flavor ,  and all i could think was that i much preferred the fatter ,  fluffier ,  punchier macarons at luna ,  my go-to place for sweet treats .  coquette also serves some other baked items and cheeses ,  but nothing more substantial -- it would be great if they had light lunches like quiche and salad on offer as well .  still ,  this is a good place to sit down for a tea or coffee if you ' re in the university circle area . 
__label__4 hooray !  a macaroon place in cle !   had been hearing about this place from so many people ,  so just had to stop by last night as we were waiting for some friends .  it ' s cute inside- i love the artwork ,  the tables ,  the furniture- there ' s some real love put into that cafe .   and when you look at the display case ,  it just invites you to try their amazing sweets .  from macaroons to gourmet chocolate or fruit desserts ,  coquette patisserie has it all .  what was cool too is that they ' re open somewhat late .  oh yayyy !  !  i get so frustrated in cle when nothing is open .  .  .  and sometimes ,  you just need some sweet in your life late at night .   what ' s cool about coquette patisserie too is that they serve wine ,  drafts ,  and french press coffee .  and it ' s all quality stuff .  along with my macaroons  ( which i ' ll get to in a minute )  ,  i asked them for a cup of their french pressed coffee to go .  it wasn ' t on their menu  ( it looks like they serve mostly in house french pressed coffee )  ,  but they were like ,  "sure ,  we ' ll do it for you ! " out come my delicious dark french pressed coffee .  the owner asked me if i wanted cream or milk  ( i said cream )  ,  and he even came around the desk to check if there was cream out  ( awwww so sweet !  )  .  there wasn ' t ,  so he gave me a little cup of some delicious cream ,  measured out to be just right for my coffee  ( how did he know ?  ?  )  ,  and man ,  that was one delicious coffee .  i couldn ' t stop drinking it .  it was really good ,  and believe me ,  i ' m a coffee snob ,  and it was a really great cup of coffee .  : )   anyways ,  now the macaroons-  we just tried 4 of them:  - giandaja: two thumbs up  ( and my big toes too )  .  delicious ,  soft ,  just the right amount of sweetness ,  yep ,  i like that flavor .   - cafe au lait- my fave .  it really did taste like a cafe au lait- i bit into it and was like ,  "omg ,  it really tastes like a cafe au lait ! " .  yep- that was my fave by far .   - lemon- this one was pretty good ,  not my fave though .  i think they do their sweet macaroons really well ,  but their fruity ones are good ,  but not as good as the sweet ones .  the lemon one didn ' t have as strong of a taste that i would have liked  ( but then again ,  i like my lemons real sour )  ,  so it was alright .   - lingonberry- this was also good ,  but not one of my faves .  i think i prefer the sweet macaroons .  .  . but that ' s just a personal preference .   anyways ,  we chatted with the owner for a little bit about the place ,  and when i asked him how he liked having a storefront now ,  he responded with "i love it . " that ' s true love and happiness in a business ,  and it made me want to support them even more .   so yay !  i approve .  when i need my fix of macaroons- no need to beg my other cities friends to send me them ,  i ' ll just take a walk over to coquette patisserie ,  where my craving can be complete ! 
__label__4 four stars only because they don ' t offer more food and i wish they did so i could spend more time there .  however ,  the atmosphere is magical ,  especially at night .  the macarons are always fabulous and their ever-changing flavors add excitement to every visit .  the space is small but cozy and the staff behind the counter add to the warmth . 
__label__4 i ' ve been hitting this place up for their macarons ,  both through telephone order and buying on the spot from their booth at the north union farmer ' s market .  britt & co .  are a pleasure to deal with .  prices for the macarons are reasonable .   the macarons themselves were good .  they have a nice light ,  airy texture ,  but can get very fragile when at room temperature too long .  they ' re also a bit on the smaller side .  i ' ve tried a total of maybe 10 or so flavors ,  and while a few were distinct and delicious ,  others tasted like they had little flavor other than the standard almond and buttercream .  my girlfriend suspected that they only incorporate the flavors into the buttercream filling and not the biscuit as well ,  and she might be right .  she prefers the lighter flavors though ,  so it works out for her .  ones that stood out to us were: cassis ,  blueberry ,  lemon ,  and pistachio .   i ' ll definitely continue to support them as they are one of the very few businesses in the cleveland area that offer macarons . 
__label__5 i was very excited to visit the place and even more excited when i found out they offered afternoon tea .  fortunately ,  i got a reservation to enjoy it and was not disappointed .  they presented the food very well and it was delicious .  their service was great and they even went above and beyond to accommodate dietary restrictions .  i would definitely recommend . 
__label__2 over priced tarts ,  ordered something for thanksgiving and spent more than $80 on two tarts and both were not edible  ( chocolate and pecan / mixed but tart )  ,  we ended up tossing it .   the main thing this place is nice for is ambience and a quick "french-cliche" fix .  the place during the day is filled with stay at home moms--night is filled with college students looking for a sophisticated break .  the place is a nice contrast to chain pastry shops ,  so i do recommend supporting this business ,  but no impressed .  over priced without much to the pastries ,  desserts and especially the inedible tarts . 
__label__5 coquette patisserie has apparently been selling its macarons  ( and other pastries )  at some of the local farmers '  markets around town for a few years ,  but they only just opened their storefront in the euclid 115 building across from uptown .  it ' s an interesting hybrid of pastries + bar .   i stopped in this afternoon on opening day and bought a variety of macarons .  all of them were excellent ,  from the traditional flavors like chocolate and vanilla to the more novel ,  like a bleu cheese bacon offering .  i didn ' t have a chance to try anything else ,  but it all looked delicious .   in addition to macarons an an assortment of other french pastries ,  coquette patisserie sells wine ,  champagne ,  and an assortment of craft beers .  champagne offerings were good ,  and between $9 and $11 a glass .  the mix of beers on tap was also nice: two brothers sidekick ,  jackie o ' s mystic mama ipa ,  jolly pumpkin la parcela ,  la chouffe ,  maredsous 10 tripel ,  and left hand fade to black .  pints from $5-8 ,  so more than reasonable .  unfortunately ,  i didn ' t have a chance to investigate the wine list .   seating consists of a few small tables for two as well as a small bar .  everything is made fresh in the store ,  and there ' s a side window into the kitchen if you want to watch the chefs at work .   best of all ,  it ' s open until 12am on tue-sat ,  giving the university circle area a nice ,  upscale spot to grab a few drinks; it would be a great place to end a date .  coquette patisserie is a great addition to the neighbourhood and unique in cleveland . 
__label__1 home phone and internet installation was efficient and painless .  the problem is ,  without having given anyone my new home phone # ,  i ' m getting 5-10 telemarketer calls a day asking for me by name .  so ,  essentially ,  at&t farms out your information to marketing list without consent .  shady and annoying - never thought i ' d say this but i want to switch back to time warner . 
__label__1 our at&t modem went out monday .  i had a spare 1800 and got that running with help from their tech support .  tech said i would need a new modem and to call in to the retention dept .  i did and received high pressure sales to switch to uverse .  sales lady said i can switch for $30  ( from $57 / month )  .  told me i would have 18 mbps .  she started berating me for not signing on right away .  i hung up .  i called the next day and the sales woman told me i would only get 6 mbps for $30 a month and that 18 mbps would cost me $40 a month and require a tech to come out .  i told her that she should tell her management about the lies i received from the other sales person who was supposedly a manager in the department )  .  she refused saying that they do not keep records of who called unless a sale was made .   and yet monday ' s liar said they keep phone records of all conversations .  i told her i would call back but she demanded that i let her call me back .  high pressure ,  rude and a pack of liars .  i am not answering the phone .  seems every-time we request a change they lie and overcharge  us and try to sell us uverse .  they lost our phone service business because the one woman lied when she supposedly quoted us a cheaper bundle .  an at&t male employee called back to tell me that the package the other woman had quoted me would actually cost me more so he switched it back .  so who was lying .  was he just cutting her throat for the sale s commission ?  seems that way .  we simplified the process and dropped at&t phone service .  apparently at&t motivates their sales force with sales incentives paid to their credit cards .  they keep lying year after year that dsl will no longer be offered and we will lose our internet and that we must switch to uverse .  dsl used to be packed with directv and yet we never received a package deal and received two separate bills .  their 2wire modems last just a month or so past the warranty period .  reviews on their modems reveal that the modems are unreliable and burn out .  pack of liars lost our business ! 
__label__3 glad i went during the free time ( the first monday of every month 5-7:30 )  . wasn ' t impressed but my kid had fun . 
__label__2 friendly and inexpensive but also run down and minimally educational .  we have been to a dozen other children ' s museums that were nicer with more to do .  water table area was most interesting . 
__label__4 we love children ' s museum outings .   small and contained to 3 floors ,  but lots to do .   the first floor usually has a different exhibit every few months .   this time it is abracadabra .   all different types of magic tricks ,  funny mirrors and interactive magic show .   the 2nd floor is all pretend play .   be the driver of the rta ,  drive a car ,  go to grocery store and fill up a cart and scan items .   kids will love the 2 floor pretend office building .   1st floor is dr .  office complete with costumes ,  equipment and an examining table .   upstairs is a day care / nursery complete with dolls ,  clothes cot etc .   my kids spent a good 45 minutes just in there !  the 3rd level has a large water / splash table complete with boats and rubber ducks**grab on of the raincoats on the hook*  one area i don ' t get to anymore is for kids 5 and younger .   it is a big room set up like a farm .   kids can climb a few steps up the barn and down a little slide .   they can pick all types of vegetables and put them in their baskets .   very fun  we always pack a lunch and eat it at their picnic table .   they don ' t have food for sale .   they do have a little gift shop .  ** i believe it is $7 . 00 for children and $6 . 00 for adults
__label__5 the best pizza in parma ,  hands down .  .  . fast friendly pick up or delivery service ,  coupled with an eclectic menu of specialty pizzas ,  along with build-your-own options .   pick up their loyalty card and get a free pizza after ten orders . 
__label__5 great pizza !   after trying most of the pizza shops in parma ,  i have to say this is one of the best .   food is fresh and tastes great .   delivery is quick .   definitely worth a try ! 
__label__5 consistently great pizza .  great quality for the price and the staff is great .  highly recommended .  also they have a stamp card that will get you a free pizza ! 
__label__1 we are in cleveland for a volleyball tournament and decided to try napoleons pizza based on the 4 . 5 star reviews .  this pizza was a huge disappointment ! mediocre pizza at best .  very doughy ,  very few toppings .  3 pieces of pepperoni and 2 mushrooms per piece - really ?  !  ? 
__label__4 recommended to me: the tool shed / man ' s world ,  local levi / leather bar .  friendly guys and lots of fun . 
__label__3 i went back .  .  .  . still great selection of cigars but they are overpriced .  .  .  . but then again i usually buy my cigars online which tends to cheaper i suppose . 
__label__1 cleveland usps location at 44103  extremely poor customer service .  i ' ve dealt with 4 different supervisors through phone ,  and every single one of them has rude attitude and is super unprofessional .  in the last 3 months ,  i had more than 10 packages delivered to my house from this usps location ,  and about half of them were late by four-five days .  when i call them to know the whereabouts ,  the supervisors show irritation towards me ,  and they are non-apologetically rude about it .   to be honest ,  customer service doesn ' t entirely matter as long as i get my package on time ,  especially when i actually pay extra shipping fee from amazon .  but when these guys mess up ,  then there is absolutely no purpose of me paying for extra shipping service .  what bothers me the most is that the carrier would simply indicate the package as  ' delivered '  when it ' s actually just sitting at their office .  i ' m not assuming this because they themselves  ( supervisors )  acknowledged ,  that their carrier has too many packages to deal with ,  they just scan it as  ' delivered '  as soon as the package arrives to the post office .  the cons about this issue ?  after getting notification saying that my package is delivered ,  i go out to check my mailbox during freezing cold weather and nothing is there .  .  .  for days .   i can go on and on ,  but if i had the control of choosing another post carrier ,  without hesitation i want to switch .  this branch is just too ridiculous . 
__label__3 had a large group in 30+ .  very friendly but just average food and drinks . 
__label__3 nothing too special here ,  but there ' s usually decent live music on the weekends .  lots of tvs if you want to watch a game or something though i think you could find a much better place to watch a game downtown . 
__label__3 subway  !   i have had subway sandwiches for as long as i can remember .  so instead of writing about what this subway has i will write what is different than a typical subway .   1 .  it is not heavily staffed during the evening hours .   2 .  there is ample room to sit and enjoy and it is empty for the most part .   3 .  they have veggie patty ,  which is nice for vegetarians .   4 .  vegetables are not always fresh .   5 .  the street parking is free after 6 pm and on sundays .    enjoy healthy food . 
__label__5 i love dr .  fegan and the staff at big creek vet hospital !     i have been bringing my pets there for about 4 years now and i have never had a bad experience .   it is so important and hard to find a doctor of any kind that you can really trust .   especially if you are trusting them with the care of your furry friends .   i have always been greeted with a smile and made to feel welcome .   they are usually very good at getting you in appointments right away and calling you back promptly if you have any questions .   to all of you rat owners out there  ( yes ,  rats-  they are wonderful pets .  )  ,  i highly recommend going to big creek if you are having trouble finding a vet that is knowledgeable about rodents !   so many vets really aren ' t familiar with caring for rats or they are looked at as less important than cats or dogs .   trust me ,  i have bonded with many a ratty over the years and they will steal your heart .  what won me over was whenever i would bring in one of my ratties ,  dr .  fegan always kissed them on the head when she picked them up to examine them .   yes !   now that is a really animal lover .   i have had to have a few rats put to sleep and the vet techs are very sympathetic and kind .   they know how to put a rat to sleep comfortably and ethically  ( if you are a rat owner and you have done your research ,  you know that the way rodents are normally "put to sleep" is gruesome and horrifying )  .  plus ,  they give you a little keep sake of your pets paw prints in clay to take home with you along with grieving literature .   interestingly ,  i now have 3 cats  ( all my ratties have crossed the rainbow bridge )  and this is the vet i will continue to bring them to even though it ' s a little further of a drive from where i live now .     lastly ,  another great thing about this vet is that you have 30 days of free follow-ups every time you need to bring your pet in for a visit . 
__label__3 ingenuityfest was something i looked forward to every year around the time summer ends and fall sets in .  it was once a brilliant festival surrounded by art installations ,  colorful lights ,  robots and shit ,  future technologies ,  and interactive exhibits .  it was fresh and always unique .  i loved the ideas and art that were presented to the public .  i saw dragonette and the knocks perform one year .  ingenuityfest was one of the best cleveland festivals during the end of summer .   today i come to the realization that whoever runs ingenuityfest has completely lost focus on what ingenuityfest is .  i ' m sad to admit that they have completely sold out .  i ' m all about supporting and showcasing local artisans and whatnot ,  but i don ' t need another overpriced flea market mixed in with wholesale windows and patio construction companies taking over spots where arts ,  music ,  lights ,  and technology should be .  i want to press buttons ,  listen to electronic made music ,  see robots fight ,  and be immersed in the whole experience itself .   i want to give a shoutout to loren naji for his awesome display of scrap metals turned into musical instruments .  he invited everyone to come pick up a stick and bang drums and anything that would make noise .  he invited us to put our guards down and join together to feel free and make loud noises .  all the kids ,  old people ,  asians ,  and women came together to fucking wreck the last day of ingenuityfest . 
__label__2 the concept of having a fest / gallery under a bridge is very cool .  i heard about this from my friend so had to check it out myself .   local artists displayed their work and some were very impressive while others should have stayed at home .  they served beer and had various food trucks which was great as well as live music and djs playing throughout the bridge .  my friend was hearing heels and had problems walking through a part of the bridge which i had to help her across and saved her from falling .  the whole presentation itself was lackluster but there is room for improvement .  it was definitely a nice change of pace for a night out but do not think i would go again . 
__label__5 amazing property .  was like a trip to europe .  wonderful getaway a must when in cleveland !   lots of awards but the most friendly folks on the planet .  can ' t wait to go again .  watch for summer bargains in the bar and on the patio !   no disappointments here ! 
__label__4 it ' s taken me nearly a week to write this review because i ' m so torn .   the experience was great .   the food was great .   but i don ' t feel compelled to go back .   and i ' m not sure why .   the bf and i started with happy hour at the bar:  pork belly: 4 / 5 .   while delicious ,  it was missing something to make it 5-star excellence .   french fries: 3 / 5 .   i was underwhelmed by these ,  but i ' m also a french fry snob .   however ,  the dipping sauce that they come with is really good .   the bf gives the sauce alone a 5 .   vietnamese calamari: 5 / 5 .   definitely the happy hour star .   cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly .   best calamari i have ever ,  ever had .   cheese puffs: 3 / 5 .   these underwhelmed me .   throw some melted cheese in the center of these babies ,  and you ' ll have a 5-star app .   drinks: 3 . 5 / 5 .   we sampled 5 different martinis  ( lavender ,  lemon drop ,  sparkling cosmo ,  cherry cheesecake ,  icewine martini )  .   the bf loved the lavender and lemon drop ,  but i wasn ' t terribly impressed with the three i had .   although ,  they did get me pretty drunk .   overall ,  i think happy hour is worth trying out .   they have some solid drink options and really good food options .   not the best happy hour in the city ,  but it ' s definitely on the top of the list .   we were seated for dinner at 5:30 ,  and the restaurant is beautiful; one of the most romantic restaurants i ' ve been to in the area .   it was the perfect place to celebrate valentine ' s day .   our waitress was very friendly ,  too .   oxtail pierogies: 5 / 5 .   so so so so good .   this dish was the overall star of the evening .   the oxtail is served over the pierogie instead of inside ,  which i think made the dish perfect .   it metled in my mouth .   shrimp & grits: 5 / 5 .   the third star of the evening .   i don ' t even like  grits  ( hate the texture )  but i wanted to lick the plate clean .   smooth and cheesy and yummy .   veal meatloaf: 4 / 5 .   this was the bf ' s main course .   he said it ' s the best meatloaf he has ever had .  .  . but it ' s still meatloaf .   the white cheddar mashers weren ' t memorable .   while this plate was delicious ,  nothing took it over the top .   mack and cheese: 4 / 5 .   really frickin '  good .   very rich and creamy ,  as to be expected .   the flavors worked really well together .   however ,  i ' ve had better macaroni and cheese elsewhere ,  so i can ' t give it the full 5-stars .   jeni ' s ice cream trio 4 / 5- the homemade cones were really ,  really salty .   while i usually like the salty / sweet combo ,  i felt it interfered with the jeni ' s .   also ,  i wish they had used jeni ' s creative flavors instead of chocolate ,  vanilla ,  and pear .   so ,  while everything was really ,  really good ,  there ' s nothing that really makes me want to come back .   i feel like we ' ve tried most of the exciting things on the menu ,  and none of it was enticing enough to make me want to come back again .   however ,  there isa good chance that in a couple of months i ' ll get a hankering for some good calamari and find myself at the happy hour once more ! 
__label__5 this is an interesting place ,  on the fringes of the cwru campus and little italy .   it has an inn that has won awards .   we did not stay overnight ,  but came here for dinner .   the ambiance is cozy and somewhat romantic .   the service has always been friendly .   the menu has a nice selection of items ,  nothing very esoteric or unusual .   there is a nice wine list and drink menu - warm cider with rum on a cold evening does hit the spot .   the best part of dining here is execution - the food is served warm ,  cooked to perfection .   leave room for dessert .   they have a very nice selection of season sweet items .   i highly recommend this place for its consistently good food and service . 
__label__5 monkey bread monkey bread monkey bread brunch here is awesome for aforementioned reasons .  i usually get the steak and eggs which is great .  the mussels appetizer is pretty big and really great for sharing with a group .   also ,  love the $5 burger and fries .  simple ,  well done ,  flavorful and cheap !  their drink specials change all the time and they ' re always great .   the service is always top notch from the hostess to the server to the valet guys .   i loooovve the patio in the summer !  !   their donut bread pudding from presti ' s ,  i have never had it at presti ' s but it is foodgasmic .   summary: monkey bread ,  donut bread pudding ,  burger night
__label__5 a great place for a friday night meal .  happy hour is till seven and it has a great beer special that is four dollars !  !  i got the five dollar burger which includes garlic fries that are amazing .  i would recommend this place only downfall is to get these bar specials you need to sit in bar seating which can be crowded ,  first come first serve  !  ! 
__label__2 i couldn ' t believe that this restaurant could be out of their featured special by 6 pm on a saturday night !    boy does that say a lot !   and they don ' t know how to make the native new orleans drink called the sazarac .   ours was pretty nasty .   on the plus side the waitress and the staff were very friendly .   but be sure to look at your bill before you leave .  there were four of us and we split or four entries amongst us .  however the waitress billed us for five entries .  shame on us for not looking at the bill more closely when we split the checks up .   however ,  the manager has not refunded us the cost of the extra dinner despite at least three of our requests .   he agreed to credit our credit card but has failed to do so after two months .   i guess we ' re stuck but we will never go back . 
__label__1 terrible experience .   we were the only table there .   hostess / waitress was nice but took 15 minutes to bring drinks .  stuffed mushroom appetizer took 20 minutes ,  only to discover a big hair on the plate .  couple this with the kitchen staff and cleaning staff yelling and cussing at each other made for good reason to leave and not want to go back .  no manager seemed present and nobody seemed to care .  would not recommend . 
__label__1 offense--stinks defense--stinks special teams--only reason i watch ,  thanks to cribbs ,  and now he ' s hurt  best move i made was not renewing season tickets .   had been a fan forever but now i ' m just a jilted former lover . 
__label__2 tale of two franchise .   the first branch of this franchise was dominate in the 1950s .   the best football player in any era .   in 1980s had tough losses in big games that changed the direction of the franchise .   however ,  they have very loyal fans  ( even after the move to baltimore )  .   soon but surely the current management will have the right personnel ,  right coaches to turn things around so that region and winner can be a winner .   grade: d
__label__3 a no-brainer .  it ' s an irish pub for sure and both the vibe and the food are perfect complements to the stiff drinks and nice vibe . 
__label__3 i went to flannerys pub recently and ordered a steak .  .  . i asked for it to be cooked medium .  .  . and when we got our food ,  the waitress walked away before asking me to cut into my steak and make sure it was cooked to my liking and it was definitely over cooked and dry .  .  . and i should have sent it back but our waitress didn ' t come back in a short amount of time ,  and i was hungry .  .  .  . im not hard to please as long as my order is correct .  .  . so i will go back there .  .  . but ill never order a steak ever again .  .  . 
__label__2 quite disappointing to say the least .  uninspired pub that felt like they just didn ' t try to put forth some effort .  got onion rings and then the recommended fish and chips .  both dishes were coated in grease and that left an un-appetizing feel and taste overall .  rings were just standard fare with nothing special and the fish was just whatever .  fries were an absolute afterthought and that ' s one of my pet peeves .  i can ' t stand it when restaurants mail it in on the fries .  nothing was absolutely horrible and that ' s why they got the 2 stars instead of 1 .  however ,  i was hoping for so much more from the other reviews and definitely recommend checking out the other restaurants in this neat area . 
__label__2 nice enough looking bar .   staff was hit or miss with some good and some indifferent .   my friend got threatened by a bum here and the staff didn ' t really seem equipped to handle that type of situation .   considering their location you ' d think they ' d have better security .   i guess that ' s cleveland for ya . 
__label__1 after seeing all the great ratings i was very disappointed .  we ordered four appetizers .  the calamari was hard and rubbery .  the onion rings had no flavor .  the tipsy shrimp tasted like it was dipped in campbell ' s tomato sauce .  the bruschetta was passable . 
__label__4 not a great atmosphere but really friendly staff and pretty good food .   i had the baked 1 / 2 chicken ,  not something that i would normally order but was recommended by the server .   it was excellent . 
__label__4 always my favorite when it comes to chinese .  generous portions ,  great service and easy on the wallet .  wonton ,  hot sour or egg drop soups are wonderful .  eggrolls ,  potstickers or crab rangoon are my choices for appetizers .  .  . moo shu pork or general tso chicken are my favorite entrees
__label__1 and frontier strikes again .  i had a carryon and a backpack .  all of the sudden the size limits changed for the carryon .  they tried to charge a whopping 60 bucks to check the carryon ,  despite it being about the size of my backpack .  they changed their size limit and now instead of a suitcase being measured by dimensions  ( in my opinion is only fair )  it has to physically fit into a small metal space ,  wheels included ,  or you ' ll have to check it .  never again
__label__1 i am disgusted with this airline ,  i had to buy a ticket quickly because my husband had an organ transplant in cleveland ohio ,  i understand the fare would be high on short notice  ( one way $500 . 00 for cleveland to lax )   but really ,  $40 . 00 for a carry on and $35 . 00 to check a bag ,  extra charge for most of the seats on the plane ,  i am flying back the sunday after thanksgiving and there were two exactly two seats that i did not have to pay for but at least 20-25 with a charge ,  if they have that many vacant seats on this flight after the biggest holiday weekend of the year i am not the only one who is choosing any other carrier if they can . 
__label__4 frontier seems to get a lot of hate so i was a bit worried when a group of friends decided to fly to las vegas from cleveland using frontier ,  but i was actually pleasantly surprised with frontier airlines .  i booked two round-trip tickets online with two checked bags and it came out to $334 . 20 per person .  you can guarantee your seats by paying a fee to pick them in advance ,  but i skipped this and just checked us in 24 hours before the flight and we had no problem with getting seats right next to each other for no extra charge .  the flight out was on time and even got us to vegas a little bit earlier than scheduled .  the flight home was on time as well .  no delays like others have experienced .    i always like to be prepared so i read the terms ,  conditions ,  and restrictions so there was no surprise about the size of carry-on ' s or what in flight service covers .  we also showed up an hour and a half before our flight so we had plenty of time to drop off our luggage ,  go through security ,  use the restroom ,  and grab waters for our four hour flight .  when it comes to snacks ,  since everything is more expensive at the airport ,  it just makes more sense to bring your own snacks .    the planes were clean ,  the seats are thin but not uncomfortable ,  at an average height and weight i had no issues with space ,  and no negative interactions with staff or fellow passengers .  yes the tray tables are smaller and there is no tv screen in the back of the seats ,  but for me this was not a big deal .  i knew i was flying a budget airline so i wasn ' t expecting bells and whistles .  i just brought a book to read for entertainment ,  talked to my friend ,  ate some of my snacks ,  and took a nap to pass time .  my only regret is that i forgot my neck pillow at home and since the seats don ' t recline nap time did involve a kink in my back and some drooling ,  but that is my fault for not being prepared .    there ended up being seven of us flying with frontier and no one had any issues .  frontier is nothing special ,  but they had reasonable accommodations and got me where i needed to be .  if frontier has the best deal in the future for a short flight across the states i would fly them again . 
__label__5 i had great service and great salmon .  my guest had a perfectly cooked and flavorful filet .  i liked every bit of the restaurant .  it was very empty and by the time we left we were the only guests .  that isn ' t a bad thing though; it was very peaceful in the dark paneled dining room with the fireplace going - the restaurant has the feel of an old school club and was quite relaxing .  i ' ll note it isn ' t the place to watch tv however - there was a very small television added as an after thought in the upper left corner of the small bar . 
__label__1 truffles has new management; the store ' s been rearranged and it ' s definitely not the same truffles that i used to love .   i used to come by here to pick up a half dozen cookies for a small dinner party; i definitely wouldn ' t do that now .   good: * cute atmosphere still ,  nice place to settle down with a cup of coffee and some work .    bad: * the pastries are not good .   they ' re too sweet ,  too heavy ,  too dry ,  and are very  homemade ,  not anything close to gourmet .   i bought a couple to try out; i took one bite and threw the rest away .   inedible .   i miss the beautiful little gourmet cakes from before .   it ' s an entirely different store now . 
__label__5 buffalo chicken mac and cheese that you eat with your hands .  .  as if that isn ' t enough ,  the chorizo meatloaf is indescribable !  i don ' t even like meatloaf and it ' s my favorite !  we definitely love chef anthony !  ! 
__label__5 i consider myself a beer connoisseur of sorts .  i make it a point to seek out new beers and rarely buy a 6-pack of the same beer twice .  the cleveland brewery ,  however ,  slipped through my consciousness for the longest time .  it has limited open hours  ( 6-10pm fri / sat )  ,  does not distribute outside of the brewery and has a less than prime location on 185th st .    when i finally heard about the brewery and made it in ,  boy was i positively surprised !  the beer was great and was a reminder of how superior the taste of small batch beer can be .  i had the imperial stout and seasonal pumpkin offering which were both fantastic .  although the location is a bit away from me ,  i plan to make it back here again due to the quality of the beer . 
__label__3 if you have to eat here ,  it is what it is .  dank atmosphere ,  attentive service ,  "just" food . 
__label__4 i was surprised to find a restaurant like sarava on the east side of cleveland .  having been to shaker square once ,  mostly for their farmer market on saturday mornings  ( which is great by the way- i found butternut squash for cheap as well as amish apple butter )  ,  it was nice to walk into a nicer restaurant on the east side of cleveland .   walked in and was seated quickly in a nice little booth .  a little dark to my liking ,  but a nice ,  well presented restaurants .  stuck with the restaurant week menu  ( i wish there was more selections )  ,  we ordered off of that .  . and i got a caipirinha to start off .  .  . which is a mix of a mojito and lime juice ?  it was okay .   appetizers: duck confit ravioli ,  goat cheese salad ,  or butternut squash bisque .  i chose the bisque- great .  not too heavy ,  not too thick-just right .  the ravioli .  .  .  . looked small .  the portion came out with three pieces .   the salad was just that .  .  .  a salad .  but i was surprised the bisque wasn ' t too thick or had too much stock in it .  .  . it was pretty good .  i like .   entree: i got the pork tenderloin .  it was good !  not too tough ,  not too heavy- was in this great sauce .  i ' m not a fan of mashed potatoes .  .  . so although i knew the dish had mashed potatoes ,  i wasn ' t a fan how it consumed about half my dish .  it ' s meant to be a side !  a friend next to me got the trout .  . which was quite good .  i liked how it had pecans in it .  .  . and it wasn ' t overdone .   dessert: i got the coconut butter cake .  mmmm .  good !  it was a tad too heavy though ,  for my liking- i finished about half the cake .  another friend got the peach cobbler .  .  . i took a bite out of his ,  and man ,  it was sweet .  too sweet .  i think they put too much sugar when they were boiling the peaches for the glaze .  but the winner of the night- i took a bite out of chocolate terrine- omg ,  i should have gotten that .  a flourless cake which was so so so so good .  that was the winner of the desserts .  : )   i would come back to sarava .  it didn ' t seem like a brazilian place though- but .  .  .  still ,  a nice place in shaker square to stop and have a nice dinner . 
__label__4 first off ,  the food was great .  no complaints here .  appetizers were excellent ,  main courses were very well done .  we left content and happy .  the atmosphere was really nice with brazilian music playing in the background ,  low lighting ,  and little noise .  definitely a romantic place .   however ,  if you ' re looking for an authentic brazilian restaurant ,  this isn ' t it .  i lived in brazil for a year and a half .  sarava ' s cuisine is more new-agey with some brazilian thrown into the mix .  i would say that about 50-60% really traces its roots to plates from brazil .  the rest of the menu looks great ,  just isn ' t brazilian .  if you ' ve got a hankering for one of the staples ,  like picanha ,  feijoada ,  farofa ,  or pie3o de queijo you can kill it here .  other touches though ,  such as vinagrete and brigadeiro were not to be found .   regardless ,  the wait staff was extremely attentive and polite .  service overall was excellent .   if i were back in the area i would return to sarava . 
__label__2 i get my giro meat here and that is all .  .  . produce is horrible !  !  !  !  !   i made the mistake of getting onions and tomatoes here but didn ' t inspect enough cause when i got home i realized both the onions and tomatoes had turned .  .  . my mistake ?  maybe but how can i grab and go everywhere else and not worry ?  i say selling bad produce is the fault of the store .  .  . 
__label__2 i drive by this place all the time ,  so i figured it was worth stopping in .   it ' s not really a true butcher shop--it ' s more like a small discount meat bodega .   the prices are good and i liked what i bought  ( italian sausage ,  smoked pork skin ,  bacon )  .  however ,  the place didn ' t look all that clean and i didn ' t see much reason to stop here instead of getting what you need at the grocery store . 
__label__5 they sometimes have succulents !  i got a really healthy jade and hens and chicks .  just writing this update so when people search for succulents this comes up : )  . 
__label__4 my dad who is in the cleveland clinic battling c  .  .  loved this place and wanted us to try .  so once he got the nod that can eat what he wants we decided to pick up food for dad after hubby and i ate .   this restaurant serves breakfast all day and is open 7 days a week 5a-9pm .  big menu  great prices .  many specials .  all meals come with choice of homemade chicken noodle or beef barley soup ,  hot rolls or rye bread and your meal .   dave ordered smoked sausage 2 large pieces served over kraut .  and mashed potatoes and gravy  .  . prior to that large bowl of homemade soup .  i had ordered cabbage rolls and the salad .   2 large nicely packed cabbage rolls served over kraut and mashed potatoes .   gave dave a cabbage roll and  still took 1 / 2 home .   we ordered my dad l beef and barley soup and liver and onions and homefries and succatash .  huge portions .   loved making dad happy and would definitely recommend this place .  great service and with 2 drinks the price .  .  .  . $30 . 00  we gave nice tip because of great service and how good the food was . 
__label__1 i wouldnt recommend this place ,  first the red chimney has mold and black dust on the ceiling and and the hvac vents .  second when i was eating there christmas eve for breakfast and this was my second time there which i  should of used my own judgment after the first time looking at how dirty the place looks ,  there was a cockroach running on our table .  i paid my bill and walked out .  what it has going for its self is cheap food
__label__5 we stopped here for breakfast while in the area !  a little scary on the outside but glad we went in !  holy breakfast for 3 . 00 !  !  !  !  !  everything was great !  ! 
__label__5 very helpful staff ,  very knowledgeable .  great selection of cheeses and other specialties .  delicious tzatziki sauce .  a great shop to have in the neighborhood ! 
__label__1 the saddest place in the world is the cleveland kennel .   that has nothing to do with the wonderful volunteers and the helpful staff that are there .  .  . but the entire situation .   as soon as you walk into the kennel ,  it smells and your ears start ringing from the barking in the back of the office .   there are rows of cold dark cages filled with surprisingly happy ,  hopeful dogs .   they do have some runs in the back that the dogs can very sparingly utilize .     their hours are terrible  ( 11-3pm )  which mean that it ' s very difficult to get over there without taking a half day from full time jobs .   in addition ,  after playing football for over two years ,  it took me that long to figure out that it wasn ' t a closed old building .   you know why ?   the kennel is the worst funded government program in cleveland .   they have a battered old sign .   rarely dogs outside .   etc .     the cages are filled with dogs that did nothing wrong ,  but the kennel is there because people didn ' t care enough about them to see to it that they found new homes .   you can ' t blame the kennel for people ' s irresponsibility ,  but none-the less ,  it ' s a dark and sad place .    speaking of .  .  .  . they do offer a low-cost spay and neuter program . 
__label__3 the reviews i ' ve been reading and the praise i ' ve been hearing have been through the roof .  i needed to see if il bacio could possibly live up to the bloated hype .  now ,  i am really torn in writing this review ,  but also feel compelled to set the record straight .  .  .  .    i ' m sad to report that il bacio really isn ' t anything special .  yeah ,  i get it; the owner is from italy ,  he ' s dreamy ,  charismatic and every time you take a bite of the gnocchi ,  you have visions of vito corleone dancing in your head .  it transports you back to the homeland .  really people ?  just because you ' re italian ,  doesn ' t mean everything you cook is divine .  same goes for any other culture .  not every american can cook a steak .  hell ,  not every american can poor a proper bowl of cereal without googling for instructions .  i really don ' t understand the free pass given to restaurant because an owner / chef is from a certain country .    now ,  onto the meal .  to start ,  our group ordered the salumi plate which turned out to be a few slices of prosciutto drenched in oil .  personally ,  i could ' ve done without the oil .  prosciutto is already a fatty piece of greasy meat .  the additional pool of oil was unnecessary .    next ,  i ordered the gnocchi which turned out to be one of the least interesting plates of gnocchi i ' ve ever had .  all the little balls of pasta dumplings came arranged on top of a bed of bland tasting sauce .    for dessert ,  i ordered the tiramisu which i pretty much have to get whenever i see it on the menu .  like the two other previous courses ,  bland and rather forgettable .  i also found it weird that it came served in a small pudding dish instead of the typical slice on a plate .     meanwhile ,  a pot-bellied older man next to us kept moaning loudly with each bite .  the sounds coming from him was either a call for immediate medical attention or serious ,  undefinable pleasure .  i couldn ' t help but notice ,  but as we ' d soon find out ,  this was his way of showing his praise for the food he was stuffing down his throat .  afterwards ,  the portly looking man ,  continuing his praise of il bacio ,  told us with much candor and great certainty that "this is the best restaurant in all of cleveland ! " i looked at him completely dumbfounded .  i want what he had .  because the three of us couldn ' t believe the claim coming from this man ' s mouth .  really guy ?  the best in all of cleveland ?  after holding back laughter ,  the old man challenged us in asking what some of our favorite places were .  after taking turns in rattling off a few favs ,  the man looked confused as if not ever hearing of any of our suggestions .    the moral of the story: everyone has differing opinions .  sometimes vastly different .  appearance isn ' t everything either .  trust your palate ,  not the hype . 
__label__5 the best italian food we ' ve found in the area .  terrific atmosphere and the service is wonderful .  we ' ve been there a few times already and always had a great experience . 
__label__3 some very good food ,  but the prices are a bit high for the serving sizes .  i had veal tortellini ,  and they were excellent ,  but i finished dinner and was still rather hungry .  my friend had gnocchi ,  and was quite disappointed .   this is a cozy little place ,  and i can say that at least some of the food is delicious  ( the tortellini )  ,  but i ' ve heard a lot of mixed reviews .  if you ' ve got some cash to use up and want to try it ,  i don ' t discourage it ,  but don ' t expect too much . 
__label__4 i ' ve been to this neighborhood gem twice now and have enjoyed both experiences greatly -- with the exception of the server i had in my most recent visit .   should you get fabi ,  she is excellent !   should you get ken ,  ask for fabi .   that way ,  besides the food and the ambiance ,  you will also enjoy your server .   the menu is replete with choices -- and as you are unable to taste everything your first go around ,  you will have to come back for more .   there are always specials in each of the three categories  ( appetizers ,  salads ,  entrees )  ,  so don ' t make any decisions until you ' ve heard about these additional savory choices .   the desert choices aren ' t unusual ,  so do choose an appetizer and a salad to round out your evening ' s dining experience .   lovely and delicious food .   so pleased that this spot finally has a restaurant that will stick ! 
__label__5 this is one of my favorite restaurants in cleveland !  i ' ve been here a few times ,  and each time its great .  its really authentic northern italian cuisine ,  and the owner is always there .  the food is exceptional ,  and i ' m pretty sure the menu changes periodically .  service is impeccable .  the only downside is it ' s small ,  and can get crowded / loud on a friday / saturday night .  the food makes it waaay worth it though ! 
__label__2 were we at the wrong restaurant ?  what a disappointment !  i had heard and read some pretty good things about il bacio so we gave it a try last night .  won ' t be going back any time soon .  there were 4 of us and the best that anyone had was mediocre .  i should have been suspicious when at 8 o ' clock on saturday night the place was 75% empty and it just thinned out further from there .  we all ordered drinks  ( the most complicated of which was grey goose on the rocks )  and that took almost 20 minutes to arrive .  we split 2 appetizers  ( sauteed calamari c- and prosciutto w / mozerella d+ )  .  the entees were linguine w / white clam sauce c+ ,  a cheese ravioli ,  the hit of the evening b- and i had the ciopino special ,  a solid d .  the calamari inside was very chewy and tasteless ,  the scampi was served in the shell and took way too much effort to peel and the broth was amazingly bland .  every other ciopino that i have had has been bursting with falvor .  not this one .  now for the kicker .  it was $40 !  !  !  i know that i should have asked the price when ordering it but never in my wildest dreams did i think it would be so much .  had it been great ,  or even good ,  i probably would have just shrugged it off but that kind of money for a seriously disappointing dish just really hurt .  with so many other good italian restaurants in little italy ,  i don ' t see this one sticking around very long without some big improvements . 
__label__4 only reason i can ' t give this place a 5 is that it is fairly pricey .  nice ,  intimate atmosphere ,  decent portions ,  but truly some of the best food in the area . 
__label__1 bought a groupon as a christmas gift  ( expires oct 2015 )  ,  registered for a class in may and tracie sell vp of private event operations canceled the class and told us to book another in may .   my mom emailed a few times to ask about other upcoming months because we did not have any interest in the other two may paintings and did not receive a single response .   there aren ' t any classes posted for the rest of the year .   we didn ' t want to waste our money painting something we were not interested in .   i cannot get in touch through email ,  phone ,  or facebook .   i am completely disgusted with the unprofessionalism . 
__label__2 went last thursday .  very disappointed .  guac was bland ,  no flavor at all .  service unattentive ,  dirty hands chipping at ice to put in drink was odd .  .  . i chose not to drink it .  spoiled crab in my tacos ,  instant stomach churner .    quality poor ,  service poor as well .  big disappointment . 
__label__4 came here with my family on a random trip to cleveland .  a bit expensive  ( i kind of expected that from the hipster vibes )  but the food was really good .  i got the carnitas tacos and the pork was cooked in this sort of citrus-y sauce .  sounds weird but it was really good !  my margarita was gross but i did that to myself by being silly and choosing the habanero peach  .  .  . yea ,  i know .  i ' d come back if someone else was paying .   ** super important - the menu was a bit confusing ,  but our wait did a really good job explaining everything . 
__label__5 this is my second show at this theater .  first was death trap which was great and now i ' m here to see king lear .  the theater is smaller but very beautiful and the seating is comfortable .  the acting is on point and this is a very enjoyable place to watch art . 
__label__1 i had a decent experience ,  until i checked out .   i left two electronics items in the room when i departed ,  and realized the next morning .  when i called to inquire ,  the operator told me to leave a message and they would get back to me .  after three calls to the manager and staff ,  i tried calling corporate "customer service . " unfortunately ,  they did little to help .    when the manager finally called me back ,  nearly five hours after my original call ,  he said there was nothing he could do .  he did admit that the room had been vacant since i had left ,  and that only hotel staff had accessed the room .  i was offered no recourse .   needless to say ,  stay away from this place .  there are better options nearby with better amenities  ( such as a pool )  . 
__label__4 the staff really made this place a great stay .  it is a budget hotel which is cheap and cheerful ,  and you definitely get what you pay for .  the staff is amazing and it is a perfect hotel for a short stay .  can be loud during baseball games but that ' s not the fault of the hotel . 
__label__2 nice bed ,  room noisy ,  even with ear plugs o could hear some certain machines every 2 minutes ,  couldn ' t sleep .  i got a dirty towel hanging  .  .  .  . 
__label__4 usually i love dragon tower .  sometimes it is average and sometimes great .  i wish the food was more consistent because the staff is always excellent . 
__label__5 went here on a suggestion from a co-worker and couldn ' t have been more pleased .   great food ,  portions are plenty and the service was quick and friendly .   the restaurant was very clean and easy to find .   i highly suggest this for lunch .  .  . 
__label__3 clean laundry mat but lots of moolah .  spent $8 . 50 on one load .  dryers were horrible . 
__label__5 i have been to other massage therapists but have never had the wonderful experience that i have had here .  honestly ,  after my first massage ,  i was able to stop using a cane to help me walk .  i have continued to follow dawn ' s instructions and have a massage each week .  the health benefits are amazing .  my osteoarthritis issues are lessening and i am a much happier person .  i would recommend dawn to anyone who is interested in feeling better ! 
__label__5 i ' ve taken my car to alternative solutions twice and have been very pleased with the service and pricing .  they are able to get my car serviced on short notice and there is no high pressure sales tactics or up-selling services i do not need .  staff are friendly and helpful too .  will absolute go back to these folks for any car troubles . 
__label__1 it was conveniently located ,  delivered to our hotel room door ,  and cheap .  and gross .  it actually is ,  literally ,  the worst pizza i have ever had .   it was soggy and the dough chewy ,  the cheese tasted weird like it was freezer-burned or something ,  and the pepperoni wet and sad .   after trying to get through a piece like a champ ,  i gave up and ordered from someone else .   do yourself a favor and pass . 
__label__4 proving that great coffee can now even be found in  ' fly-over country '  cleveland ' s duck + rabbit coffee takes the "do one thing ,  do it well" concept to a brooklyn or portland-esque level by house roasting every bean served on premises ,  the cutesy logo and name no indication whatsoever that these folks are not serious about their craft .   all exposed brick ,  reclaimed wood and metal stools ,  the money more importantly invested in high end burr grinders ,  hoppers ,  roasters and an industry standard espresso machine from la marzocco the choices at duck + rabbit coffee are relatively straightforward with three varietals and a focus on pour-over ,  espresso ,  or cappuccino ,  the careful medium-roast clean and smooth regardless of brewing method ,  a slight hint of residual acid making sweetener completely unnecessary amidst the single-origin kayon ' s jammy notes and a bold cocoa aroma . 
__label__5 love this place !  it ' s so cute !  plenty of natural light ,  perfect spot to study for school and enjoy some amazing iced coffee . 
__label__5 so .  .  . i always wondered when a new coffee place would open that would challenge rising star .   and boom .   here it is .   industrial meets ,  "coffee production cool" in this insanely good coffee joint .   i always love the look and feel of a working coffee lab .   limited ,  bar top style seating .   in fact ,  only 7 seats in the place .   but the coffee delivers .   $4 . 50 for a medium whole milk latte .   it is nice to see more businesses invest in this area and not leave velvet tango room hanging .   2 thumbs way up . 
__label__4 i love the space !  it isn ' t big in terms of a seating area ,  but it is really nicely built out for what it is .  there is a nice counter seating area facing the street .  there are four stools along the window .  the table height is a bit high for laptop use ,  but it is fine for reading or conversation .  there are also three stools facing the roaster .    there is whole milk and almond milk available .  i chose to have an almond milk cappuccino  ( $4 . 50 )  .  even for take away my drink was served with nice basic milk foam art .    the worker was friendly and the line moved quickly .    plenty of free street parking on both sides of the street . 
__label__5 sitting just outside ohio city it ' s certainly a "tiny" coffee shop but it has some of the best pour over espresso in the city ! 
__label__5 after working in a gym myself for the last 4 years ,  i find it hard sometimes to want to workout before or after work .  i already spend 10 hours a day there ,  another 2 doesn ' t seem like much but it is .  i explored my options and realized that i would like something between one on one training sessions and large group classes .  i had a friend refer me over to functional fitness and i have been extremely please with it ever since day one  ( mind you i ' m only a few weeks in )  .  the classes i ' ve taken range from small to medium sized ,  so it ' s still personal enough that jermail or justin are able to correct you if you are making a mistake and notice improvements .  it ' s a great 45 minute workout and i would recommend it to anyone .   if i could tell anyone looking into this gym one thing ,  it would be that when you go to drive and find it ,  it ' s in the back of the warren plaza ,  next to anytime fitness .  there is a metal door with a magnet / sign on it .  hard to miss the first time you go . 
__label__5 this is a really cool event and i find myself excited to hear where the next one will be every year !     i went in 2011 when it was under the detroit superior bridge .  what an amazing concept !  very cool art and a great band played the night that i went ,  washed out ,  which was a really nice bonus !   i had a great time so of course i had to go back in 2012 .  .    2012 was located in the port authority by browns stadium .   an interesting warehouse setup with a good selection of local stuff  ( i got a cute ring there )  and crazy art .  i didn ' t know any of the bands this time but they were enjoyable enough .  i really liked how it was right on the lake and had some tasty fried food before leaving .    overall ,  great concept and i love that they ' re highlighting areas of cleveland that are really cool but easily forgotten .  can ' t wait for next year ! 
__label__3 there is no better place to be than avalon exchange ' s new location on coventry road in cleveland heights .   fashionistas can trade their old label and designer clothes to the store for money at a much better rate than plato ' s closet  ( up to 45% in store credit or 30% in cash )  .   clothes need to be clean and good shape .   avalon exchange is still building an inventory at its ch location ,  but the real draw is the winter coats .   i found several beautiful and gently worn  ( and in style )  winter coats- for under $20 !   and hipsters get there quick because we found a few members only jackets in the men ' s section .   definitely going to keep my eye on avalon as it builds clientele and inventory . 
__label__2 today my boyfriend and i went to the mad greek this restaurant give you a choice of greek food and indian food i only tried the greek side of the menu we had mezze sampler it was really good they gave you a few choices my boyfriend had apollo chicken  it good on the plate but de tasteless i had roasted kasseri chicken it was tasteless no flavor my chicken was a little mushy good the food came out fast and the waitress was good
__label__4 this review is a bit limited ,  since i had mostly finger food and wine .  by the time i ' d gotten here ,  i ' d been up about 30 hours ,  flown across three time zones ,  eaten only crackers  ( "stewardess ,  do you have any more sprite ? " )  and did a long walk from the wrong train station to this place .    even so ,  my impression of this place was still positive .  it has that nice ,  dimly lit romantic atmosphere and the place was roomy enough that it didn ' t feel crowded despite it being fairly full .  all the finger food was excellent and the service was very attentive  ( in fact ,  they may have been refilling my wine glass a little too expertly .  .  .  )  . 
__label__4 the decor is upscale with a neutral pallet of browns ,  tans ,  and whites .   the staff is friendly and if something isn ' t right the manager is very accommodating .   i had the fried green tomatoes ,  chicken and waffles ,  and a side of the baked mac and cheese .   everything was well seasoned .   i didn ' t have to add any seasonings to the grits that came with the chicken and waffles !   truthfully i was full when i decided to try the mac and cheese and despite my fullness i ate all the mac and cheese because it was that good !   why four stars instead or five ?  i sat at the bar and had the wonderful  pleasure of hearing all the details of the bartender ' s weekend .   it was not a story appropriate for work .   it also took 5 minutes to get syrup for my waffles .   not exactly a big deal until you realize your food unnecessarily cooled down because you had to wait for the syrup to eat it . 
__label__5 being new to cleveland ,  we asked around about the best places to eat .  so many people had told us zanzibar ' s was amazing ,  so we decided to try it - despite these bad reviews here which i really do not believe accurately portray this restaurant .   our server was amazing - justin .  he was new ,  but very friendly and knowledgeable .  he told us his favorites on the menu - the turkey chops and honey fried chicken - so that ' s what we ordered .  it was amazing ,  the best food we have had so far in cleveland .  the portions were huge ,  we really could have shared one dish .  the drinks were great too .  they were a large size and they did not skimp on the alcohol content either .  we will def be going back .  don ' t let these reviews scare you .  you must go try it !  ! 
__label__4 this is a fun ,  place with a nice selection of craft beers of draught / draft .   this locally owned establishment has a creative menu that offers something for all in the group . 
__label__4 ate here last week friday after visiting the cleveland art museum .  the place was decorated nicely ,  my first encounter was with the lady at the door ,  wasn ' t too pleasant .  .  .  . but anyways meet a few friends here for a late dinner  the food was great ,  expected for my salmon croquettes ,  outside texture was a lil too toasty for me & wasn ' t feeling the gravy sauce ,  but the honey glazed fried chicken was awesome !  !  and so was the mac & cheese .  our waiter was nice ,  so the service was good .  .  . only bad thing was the table behind us was very loud & annoying .  .  . they were out celebrating a birthday ,  so it was very hard for my party to enjoy dinner & talk !  !   overall ,  i do plan on coming back cuz i cannot stoping thinking about the honey glazed chicken !  ! 
__label__5 zanzibar was a wonderful experience .  errian was our waiter he provided great suggestions and was great .  we had the soul rolls and artichoke and greens dip for starters .  i tried the honey glazed chicken for my entree .  my niece loved the sunrise kool aid .  i would definitely suggest a stop if you in cleveland . 
__label__1 dear reader ,   are you excited about experiencing some real soul food ?  well don ' t be !  this place is hor-ri-ble !  !  !  a total disappointment to us black folks that love "soul food" !  first of all i will talk about our server .  our waitress was oceanna ,  she was great !  !  !  she was the best waitress i had ever had ,  if you have her as your waitress she deserves a very nice tip !  she is truly a lovely person .  .  .  .  we had a very large party so i can tell you a bit of what to expect off the menu .   i loved loved loved ,  the soul rolls they were the bomb and the side sauce that came with them was nice and spicy and added salt to them i was truly surprised .  my mother on the other hand did not care for them .  on a down side which is minor but i suggest that the restaurant invest in little dipping cups .  it ' s so unrewarding to try to dip a giant soul roll in this tiny little paper cup that looks like something psych patients take their pills from .  and that paper after taste is really gross ,  especially when you have to squeeze the paper cup to get the rest of the sauce out .  i was afraid to ask for more sauce because they over charge for everything including $1 . 50 to substitute a side dish .   if you want to be on the safe side you might opt for the jerk chicken and cajun corn for $10 . 95 .  i had this and it was not worth it .  go to the store buy some wings sprinkle jerk seasoning on them fry them then get some corn sprinkle pepper add red and green peppers and say you got it to go from zanzibar that ' s how simple this dish was .  there was nothing special about it ,  no personality ,   finesse ,  nothing .  they could have sprinkled parsley on it or something to liven it up .  just slop on a plate .  the chicken was also dry ,  dry ,  dry ,  and came with no sauce and they needed it sooo bad !  the teazer menu says that the jerk chicken wings came with a lemon aioli sauce but why in the world are these same dry ass wings missing the sauce on the entree menu ?  what ?  and i had to break down and add salt to my chicken smdh !  do you hear me ?  i had to add plain old white table salt to already fried chicken .  so you say why didn ' t i take a pic ?  because we made reservations at 7:30 for a large party we didn ' t get seated until almost 8:30 .  so by that time and me sending my plate back to get added corn and get drinks i was too hungry to think about it .  i also ordered macaroni and cheese .   (  let me say this ,  i am not a hater by far i have no reason to hate .  the food does not live up to its hype !  it is what it is )  now ,  the macaroni and cheese .  .  .    stick to your mother ' s mac and cheese or you might do better just getting a box of shells and cheese lol .  maybe not but it ' s a tough choice .  the mac and cheese was bland ,  no seasoning what-so-ever !  they cut corners on the cheese so it wasn ' t that good old salty ,  funky ,  string ,  mac and cheese that i ' m use to .  they used too many eggs and the noodles were so over cooked .  i mean seriously how ,  does a black owned restaurant f up mac and cheese someone ' s mama need to give or receive a serious beat down lol !    as far as drinks i opted for water and a drink called hooch fusion .  the drink tasted really strong but i ' m not sure if i got a buzz from it or not i sipped it throughout the night .    briefly i ' ll talk about the other dishes that my family members and i tried;  teazers:  the fried green tomatoes were on the small side and you only receive only five of them but they where so good .   (  dave ' s is right across the street if they need larger tomatoes )    soul rolls were really good .  i love them but i ' ll try to make them at home .  along with the hot sauce sauce .   sides  ( supporting cast ) :  all of the food was room temperature and luke warm .   the cajun corn was ok just plain old tasting corn with peppers mines is better .   mac and cheese was blah and pitiful .    black eyes peas had no soul and they were blah and just boiled beans with a pinch of salt and pepper nothing else  ( no ham hocks people or smoked meat !  )  done oh so wrong .  they were sent back .   entrees: smothered ribeye streak and house potato .  the steak was nice and tender and covered in salty gravy and house potato should have been called white cheese au gratin potatoes .  it was okay ,  the portion size is very nice but a bit too much salt for me .    jerk wings so wack and gross .  dry and bland and unfulfilling .  you  defiantly need an extra side and appetizer .     center cut pork chops were also dry i ' m unsure about the taste ,  i didn ' t ask .       drinks:  the serving size of the tea and kook aid was a great size .  maybe worth the price you won ' t need a refill .   the woo woo nice smooth light colored drink   the hooch fusion strong drink with a snake bite   the maraschino cherries were gross !  !  !  !   at the end of our meal the manager shawn came to the table to greet up but he didn ' t stay long enough for us to be very honest with him .     over all the atmosphere was nice the waitress was awesome and the hostess had red hair and look like she was ready to breast feed yuck !  i won ' t be going back ever ! 
__label__5 dr . mangel has outstanding bedside manner a way of making you feel comfortable quickly ,  a sincere concern for how you feel and think ,  quick to assess and completely fix the problem .   i recommend women over 40 with a "leaky nether region" to make an appointment for a consult .   i just couldn ' t be any happier with the service and results . 
__label__2 ya know that saying ,  "you get what you pay for ? "  that applies here .   i ' ve been there twice with two different cats .   i have one cat who freaks out at the vet .   typically i have to give him valium to calm him down .   you ' re not allowed to be with your animal while they ' re being examined or getting shots .   i don ' t like this .   i want to be able to ask questions and be informed of my pets health .   my other cat was taken there to get neutered .   he was fine ,  however ,  i was bothered that when i walked in i saw a dog on an operating table with his legs up in the air .   i presume the dog was getting fixed but seriously .  .  . close the door .   nobody needs to see that .   and isn ' t that a bit of a sanitary issue ?   personally ,  i ' ll never go back ,  regardless of how broke i might be .   i ' d recommend gateway for pet care instead .   it ' s slightly more expensive but still way cheaper than a private veterinarian and the care is a million times better . 
__label__1 this bar has the rudest bartenders i ' ve ever seen !  !  !  they would rather talk to their friends instead of waiting on paying customers .  i will never go to this bar ever again .  i will also tell friends and colleagues to steer clear .  there is no excuse for ignoring customers and it is deplorable to then proceed to be so freaking rude . 
__label__4 i like ice cream every once in a while ,  who doesn ' t right !  ?  this little place is pretty good ,  nothing extraordinary but still pretty good .  their prices are reasonable and their service is good .  their ice cream tastes great and i like their shakes alot !  plus they are right outside my apartment and the put-put and golf range is right there too .  it is a pretty cool place to chill after a round of intense put-put !  i would recommend to stop there if you are driving by ! 
__label__5 it ' s sometimes hard trusting people with my natural hair ,  but carmella is such a pro .  i can ' t even begin to explain my hair struggles but a combo team of carmella and i have since rectified all of them .  it ' s been 9 months since my last visit because i moved to la .  i don ' t trust those people with my locks though so i ' ve been waiting to come back and now here we are .  i have never been happier with getting my hair done as i am after a sit down with carmella .  she makes me feel at ease ,  i literally took a nap in the chair as she finished my hair today .  that ' s how much i trust her .  eventually i ' ll have to find someone in la that i trust ,  but not anytime soon do i see another set of hands other than mine and hers touching this hair .  seriously ,  the entire staff is kind and .  .  . i could say more but just look at the before and after pictures . 
__label__4 this is my husband ' s "bar" and often i like to accompany him here with our 18-month old daughter .   i know that sounds bad ,  but this little hole in the wall is actually not a bad place to take kids and babies right around 5:30 or 6 p . m .  for dinner .   they have a great burger selection and we often see other families with young children there .   sometimes the fries can be really greasy ,  but overall it is a reasonably priced place with good burgers .   a strong staple for the heights area . 
__label__4 we live in the neighborhood and this is our go-to spot to have some beers and watch the game or for dinner on a night we don ' t feel like cooking .  lots of tvs ,  big bar .  nothing fancy - lives up to it ' s name but it ' s endearing .  the bar staff is awesome and they have a good time at work as some other reviewers said .  kelly is the best she knows the names of all the regulars and is really down to earth to chat with .   food is good .  huge selection of burgers .  monday $5 burger and labatt special is better than the one down the street and they have some other weekly specials too .  nachos are can be hit-or-miss but i ' ve had them several times and enjoyed them .    the back patio bar and seating area they opened last summer is a big plus .  we love this neighborhood bar and will go back again and again . 
__label__3 being local and without cable ,  i go out to watch games .  the pub used to be my favorite stop for games .  i have been countless times .  i kept going back because they always have a few good taps and lots of tvs and most of the time i can get a seat to watch whatever game i ' m there to see .  the service has always been good .  i ' d agree with amy below ,  the bartenders seem to enjoy what they do and the atmosphere is good .   despite frequent visits ,  i never got any food until fairly recently .  i had looked over the menu a few times ,  but i thought things were a little pricey .  i became much more interested in their menu when i started to see the daily specials board outside and i decided i need to stop in and add these guys to my east side cheap grub list .  well ,  i haven ' t done the weeknight special yet ,  but soon .   i did ,  however ,  try some of the food last weekend during the osu game .  it was good enough .  as i have mentioned elsewhere i judge a bar by their nachos ,  so i got the nachos .  i would say they pass ,  but they do not impress .  smallish quantity and nothing creative going on at all .  we also tried the mac and cheese ,  which was quite tasty .  i would recommend it ,  although the quantity / price rations still leave something to be desired .  i ' ll be going in soon to check on the weeknight specials and i ' ll be sure to report back ,  meanwhile ,  they get a pass on the food . 
__label__5 i like this place so much !  they have tons of creative burger combos and their mac and cheese always calls my name .  it ' s a total hole-in-the-wall bar in the best way . 
__label__4 this bar will always hold a special place in my heart .  i have been going here ever since i moved to the east side of cleveland .  "b" and i always go here when we don ' t feel like cooking but don ' t want to go somewhere fancy to eat .  we know we will be greeted like friends and served good food .   they have a great list of burgers .  my particular favorite is the blue shroom burger .  their mac n cheese is also laced with some scarily addictive things .  they always have a pretty good selection of beers on tap as well .  the staff is always great and attentive .  since "b" and i have been coming here ,  we have come to know their manager ,  dan ,  quite well .  he is awesome and always makes sure you have a full glass of whatever you ' re drinking and that you are satisfied with your experience .  half the reason we go here so frequently is because of him .   definitely give this place a try if you ' re passing through the heights or if you live in the neighborhood .  food is good ,  staff is great ,  and their prices are great too ! 
__label__1 wolley taxi has some of the worst customer service .   i had to reserve a cab to pick me up from the airport .   i prepaid including a nice tip .   the cab driver was neutral: not good or bad either way .   i wasn ' t able to get a receipt off of him ,  so i had to call in the morning to get it .   i called ,  and was told the manager ,  who would be in later ,  could get it for me .   i called at the stated time ,  and the manager wasn ' t there .   i left a message for him to call me .   a day passes and still nothing from them .   i call back again and the guy who answered the phone was short with me ,  especially when i challenged him to see if the manager would be in at the stated time .   either way ,  i never got my receipt ,  the service was sub-par ,  and i do not plan on ever using them again .   for a company that prides itself on service ,  they sure fell short of their mission statement . 
__label__5 this was my first time joining a csa and i was not disappointed !  i did the summer share and would consider the winter .  the vegetables and fruit were almost always incredibly fresh ,  but i did have a couple of weeks of peppers that were rotting  ( note: this is a really minimal complaint considering the sheer amount of vegetables you get )  .  next year i might opt for the vegetarian over the omnivore ,  because i ' m not a huge meat eater and you can buy the kinds of meat you want as an add on without having to be at the mercy of the share .   as an example ,  three of the weeks we got whole chickens which i get can be versatile ,  but they are really a lot of trouble to wait to defrost x 2-3 days and a pain to prepare and cook ,  especially if you ' re not a huge fan of chicken .  the turkey burgers were the best i ' ve ever had ,  and their fig goat cheese was amazing - it tasted almost like cheesecake .  i loved the weeks when we got pope ' s fresh salsa and still crave it !  it ' s very convenient that you can grab your bag from any location wed-sat and even have vacation weeks .  i will definitely be a regular user .  for $25 / week  ( prepaid )  you can ' t beat it ! 
__label__4 this taco bell has been consistently good .  i ' ve been taking my kids for chili-cheese burritos and chicken quesadillas for a couple years .  so they ' re hooked on taco bell now .   i ' m kind of hooked on the chicken quesarito .  i ' ll eat any quesarito ,  but the chicken has just the right amount of spice .  if i eat two of them ,  i ' m full and content .  .  . until my next visit .   looking forward to the upscale cantina location near my work downtown ! 
__label__2 service was very slow and the waiter did not seem happy to be there .  came in for dinner with my parents and siblings while staying nearby .  food was okay ,  but menu left much to be desired . 
__label__2 service was inept .  we sat outside on the patio and no one noticed us ,  and it took me going inside 3 separate times to ask the bartender to send a server before someone came out .  then after we ordered ,  the server came back 5 minutes later and asked everyone to confirm their order because he clearly forgot and had not yet put it in .   they had a happy hour beer menu but more than half the beers were sold out .  .  . so cross it off or reprint the menu .   food was typical bar fare ,  nothing special .  atomic dog was really good .  tacos were weak . 
__label__5 excellent bottled beer selection -- the best in the area .  the food menu is a bit limited ,  but the chicken nachos and the pulled chicken sandwich are excellent . 
__label__5 i travel quite a bit for work and have been to this restaurant twice now .  i ' ve always recieved top notch service ,  and the ambiance is very upscale while remaining authentic .  the food is amazing as well .  what really stood out is that there was a scheduled private event an hour from when i walked in they were srambling ,  but the owner graciously allowed me in and never made me felt rushed through my meal . 
__label__4 did this as take out while staying at the nearby ritz carlton .   so glad i did !  .   food was fantastic .   the restaurant is gorgeous ,  but i was by myself and needed to work .   i asked for  a special order on mixed grill 1 ,  they accommodated and it was delicious .   the baba ganouch ,  the tabouli ,  and the meat were amazing .   i can ' t wait to go back .   cleveland has a huge lebanese population ,  so the food was bound to be good .   i found it to be great ! 
__label__5 i have been to taza many times over the years and have yet to be disappointed in anything i have ordered .  i could wax poetic about the food ,  but you need to come and try it for yourself .  there are options for vegetarians ,  vegans ,  etc .   our server janette was kind ,  courteous ,  and helpful .  she was sweet and fun - and even drew butterflies on our dessert plates with chocolate .  we never had to wish for a refill because she was on it before we had to ask .    although it was a busy lunch time ,  i was in and out of this visit in less than an hour . 
__label__5 soooooo good .   salad and app sampler were delicious .  very fresh
__label__5 it ' s always a great place to choose .  i love their hummus and their kibbie is the best ,  too .  service is always amazing !  don ' t forget to check in here in order to get a free coffee and baklava . 
__label__4 taza is a new spot ,  recently opened in the warehouse district of cleveland .   it is in the spot where crop was located before steve schimoler moved it to ohio city .   it has gotten a nice redo to give it a middle eastern vive .   walls and ceiling are draped with gauzy fabrics and the lighting is softly covered with lengths of fabric and beads which give an intimate feel to it .   taza is part of the cleveland-based aladdin ' s restaurant chain  ( which has locations in chicago ,  charlotte ,  raleigh ,  toledo ,  detroit ,  columbus ,  pittsburgh ,  arlington and san antonio !  )  ,  taza is known for its wide variety of traditional mezza  ( lebanese for  ' tapas ,  '  or appetizers )  .     her twin sister is located in woodmere .     the menu says that taza uses no sulfites or any type of preservatives in the food and only the freshest vegetables and meats .   the freshness was apparent in the foods we were served .   i was there is week as part of a group who came on the recommendation of one of my husband ' s  co-workers ,  tom r .  ,  who had eaten there once and said it was really good .   it turns out that "really good"  was a bit of an understatement .   the food rocked !   we ordered assorted  entries and this is a review of those seated around me .   with a bit of encouragement ,  i took some photos which i would love to share .     the server brought out some warm puffy pita bread with zaatar  ( an ancient middle eastern herb )  and olive oil ,  sprinkled with sesame seeds ,  for dipping which was really good .   some of the bread was puffed and some was traditional flat pita .   i don ' t know if they go by different names but it was all good .   i particularly liked the warm puffs of bread which i tore and dipped into the oil .   upon the recommendation of tom ,  i ordered the "tour of lebanon" which gave a nice variety of things to sample .   i was a large serving of  shawarma  ( shaved beef that has been skewered and cooked for hours )  with grilled onions ,   shish tawook   ( grilled chicken  ( marinated in a yogurt puree over couscous )  ,   lebanese salata  (  a mixture of chopped tomato ,  green pepper ,  cucumber ,  onions ,  olives and feta in a lemon-herb dressing )  ,   hummos  (  a puree of chickpeas ,  tahini and lemon )   and baba ,  short for  baba ghanoush  ( char-grilled eggplant with tahini and lemon )  .   everything was spot on for flavors .   the serving was quite ample and i took half of it home for lunch the next day .     my husband had the falafel which came with chopped tomatoes and onions in a lemon herb dressing along with the shawarma plate which had rice .   he offered me a taste of the falafel ,  which had a crispy outer layer with a flavorful soft center .    his loved the shawarma as did i .   suzanne ,  seated next to me ,  had makanek  ( baby sausages made with spiced beef and lamb ,  sautied in a lemon-pomegranate sauce .   she offered me a taste of the sauce on some pita and it was well balanced and tasty .   she also got a salad with was huge and she took half of it to go .   we finished the meal with baklawa  ( a thin ,  phyllo dough desert ,  sweetened with syrup and dusted with pistachio dust )  .   it had a nice buttery flavor and was not overly sweet .   our server was great in making suggestions for us to try if we were unsure of something .   she was attentive without being annoying .   while we were eating ,  the owner ,   fady chamoun ,  checked frequently to see that we were all pleased with our meals .   he showed us his new ,  soon to be finished private party room which promises to be quite lovely .   we must go back again soon
__label__4 i met a few colleagues here and got a shish tawook wrap with fries .  both were really good .  i was impressed at lunch that they gave us bread and zatar dip to start . 
__label__5 what an amazing little find !  i haven ' t had lebanese cooking since my grandmother passed away a few years ago and one bite here brought back so many great memories .  the food here will not come quickly to your table ,  but that ' s because everything is made fresh and with so much attention to detail and perfect taste .  i was not disappointed and can ' t wait to come back here again .  the service was just as great and our experience was perfect from start to finish ! 
__label__5 decided to try taza on a monday night !  the decor was great .  our server was very attentive .  i ordered the lebanese cheese as a starter it was interesting with its pomegranate sauce and pistachio dust ,  it was a nice way to start my first lebanese food experience .  i ordered the beef kafta pita roll ,  which was recommended by another yelp reviewer .  excellent choice the meat was moist with a lot of different herbs and spices .  my friend and i checked in and got turkish coffee and two pieces of baklava ,  each ,  what a perfect way to end the night .  will be returning again ! 
__label__3 we decided to go outside our comfort zone and stop here for lunch .  my review is based on the fact that we have probably had true lebanese food once or twice in our lives ,  and it was given to us by the lebanese girl dating our son ,  so it was homemade and dessert ,  at that .  if you aren ' t lebanese ,  i ' ll try to explain what we experienced so your taste buds will be alerted .  if you are ,  pardon me if i get any of the spices or seasonings wrong .   firstly ,  "free" weekend parking in the area is hit or miss .  we were there on a saturday at lunch time and had to circle to actually see someone leaving within 2 blocks of the place .  good luck with that .   secondly ,  when we entered ,  no one came to seat us .  we stood in the foyer for a good 4-5 minutes waiting .  it wasn ' t until my husband actually walked into the dining area that the waitress saw us and came over .    we were seated pleasantly enough ,  and we were brought a basket of flat breads with olive oil that appeared to have a very mild black pepper as well as sesame seeds in it .  i ' m not a fan of olive oil .  i don ' t do bitters very well ,  and olive oil sets that off for me in a very unpleasant way .  the husband enjoys bitters and he was the one doing all the dipping .    we both got unsweetened iced tea ,  the regular kind ,  though they have different flavors .  no sweeteners were volunteered ,  so after 20 minutes or so ,  i had to ask .   we ordered the shawarma for an appetizer ,  and then i got the kebab pita and the husband got the lamb pita .    the shawarma was different for a non-mediterranean person .  it had peppers and onions on the plate ,  sauteed in olive oil ,  but then it also had a chopped / diced meat ,  almost like minute steaks cut up ,  in olive oil and some bitter seasoning i couldn ' t place .  it wasn ' t lemon ,  it wasn ' t citrus at all ,  but definitely very bitter .  the back sides of my tongue are bothering me now as i type this in memory .  the husband ate more of it than i did and seemed to like it .    when the meals came ,  we had a sandwich which was grilled on the outside then cut in half ,  and fries with an "ancient" seasoning on them .  i personally didn ' t know that french fries existed in ancient times ,  nor that the lebanese had a special seasoning for them back then ,  but ok .  whatever .  they weren ' t bad .  just different .    the husband enjoyed his sandwich ,  but after the first half ,  was full ,  so he disassembled it and ate the veggies he knew and the remaining lamb chunks .  he wasn ' t a fan of the pickled turnips .  i know that much .   i ,  on the other hand ,  was having a heck of a time with my kebab pita .  in each side ,  there were 3 chunks of meat ,  about the size of a standard ice cub .  that would have been fine except it was the toughest meat i ' ve eaten in a long time .  on top of that ,  it was very sinewy and hard to bite into without grabbing the entire chunk and looking extremely uncouth .  so i had to hold the sandwich to my face and chew - chew - chew - chew until i could actually bite through the gristle and sinew .  again ,  the meat was bitter tasting ,  like the shawarma ,  and on top of the pickled turnip ,  some bitter greens inside and a slightly sour sauce ,  it was too much for me .  i put the sandwich down and picked through the rest ,  eating small bites until it was time to go .    the husband enjoys bitter ,  like i said ,  but by the time we were hitting the french fries ,  he had admitted it was enough for him in one sitting ,  too .   so we paid the bill and headed out .    now ,  truly ,  i don ' t know the culture very well ,  as the girl who was dating our son remained very removed from us for almost the 4 years they were together as she lived 1200 miles away with him ,  so i can ' t say whether it was authentic food or whether it was just restaurant food .  it was good .  it was fresh .  it was very flavorful  ( especially if you enjoy the bitters )  and we did enjoy what we had .  the waitress and hostess  (  ?  )  were very attentive once we were seated and catered to our needs very well .  however ,  that said ,  i wouldn ' t go back .  it was one of those "did it ,  moving on" type experiences for me ,  and didn ' t have enough draw there to call me back for a second time around . 
__label__5 great service by pricilla !  i got the hummus falafel wrap with grilled veggies .  perfect all around .  the service made the meal .  i would def come back
__label__5 i have high standards and if it were up to me i ' d move to cleveland for this restaurant .  the service was excellent !  i probably should ' ve tipped above my usual 20% because restraint work is hard work .  the chef would make a killing if he had a tip jar !  everything and i mean everything did not disappoint !  my husband who a eat to live and drinks $2 bottles of chardonnay doesn ' t particularly care for veggies actually ate and cleaned the entire plate .  he doesn ' t  hand out accolades often .  but he had lamb shish and it was perfectly cooked well seasoned and the rice which having grown up in egypt he ' s particular about rice was on point .  i ordered chicken fattah and it was the best fattah i have had this includes in houston or washington dc which have respectable restaurant options and diversity .  the yogurt was creamy ,  the chick peas flavorful and definitely freshly made from soaking not the canned type .  the parsley was fresh crunchy and offered a refreshing cleanse of the palate that complimented the dish .  if anyone is a turkish coffee or baklava fan then you won ' t be disappointed here !  pistachio baklava is my favorite and it seems so hard to find sometimes i think it ' s because most greek and middle eastern use walnuts .  i simply loved our meal and i couldn ' t think of even one bad thing .  a customer even spilled coffee on themselves and the staff was quick to offer a clean towel and not make the patron feel embarrassed .  truly top notch service ! 
__label__5 the food was fantastic .  we love mediterranean cuisine and were quite pleased with everything that we had ordered .  there was a large group of us and we shared the vegetarian and meat appetizer platters .  both were very delicious and plentiful to share amongst 8 adults .   we had great service from our waitress and she was very accommodating to the two young children that we had at our table  ( even providing off the menu options for a picky eater )  .   we will definitely be back on our next venture into cleveland . 
__label__5 this was a great place to eat for my birthday !  claire was a wonderful waitress and did a thorough job of explaining the menu items .  i would not hesitate to recommend this place to others . 
__label__4 stop at taza was the highlight of a recent visit to cleveland .   nice accessible location ,  great food ,  friendly service .   only down side was the wine list was a little mixed up ,  but we got through it ok . 
__label__4 just lucked into this place for a monday night dinner after a 500-mile drive .  perfect !  simple and tasty middle .  east dishes .  the usual suspects all good: hummus ,  jibneh ,  kebabs ,  kafta ,  tahini ,  etc .  satisfying ,  pleasant meal far more interesting than the usual ny strip or cheeseburger . 
__label__4 we had the vegetarian feast and the manakish appetizers for lunch .   i would not recommend the zaatar manakish .   not that it wasn ' t good ,  but it is exactly like what they bring to the table for free .   i tried one of each topping  ( spinach ,  feta ,  zaatar )  ,  and definitely the spinach is the way to go because it actually has both spinach and feta on it .   the vegetarian feast itself was plenty for two to split as a meal ,  especially because they bring unlimited breads to the table .   i think the hummos ,  baba ,  tabouli ,  and falafel actually all taste very ,  very similar to aladdin ' s .   i probably prefer aladdin ' s vegetarian combo because it also includes dawali ,  which taza ' s does not .   but on the other hand ,  aladdin ' s does not give complimentary pita and zaatar .   but no matter what you order ,  definitely ask for some of their outstanding hot sauce !   i ' ve been wanting to check out taza for a long time ,  and they did not disappoint .   that being said ,  i probably won ' t go out of my way to come back any time soon .   the food was good ,  and there were many other things on the menu i want to try ,  but the service was pretty slow .   there just wasn ' t enough positives to overcome the hassle involved with eating out downtown  ( traffic ,  parking ,  etc )  .   if i ' m already downtown and looking for a place to eat ,  that ' s another story ! 
__label__5 taza is a wonderfully adorned restaurant in downtown cleveland ,  and has ,  as our server said ,  "big portions . " i went with a friend and both of us left with boxes .   having read some other reviews for the restaurant ,  i had some trepidation about going but ultimately decided that the idea of trying a new world cuisine was too enticing to be put off by an angry manager .  fortunately ,  my experience was incredibly pleasant; the manager was actually quite nice ,  and even popped outside when she noticed my friend calling me as i stood outside .  the two of us were also there for about an hour and a half ,  and neither the manager nor the waitress asked us to leave  ( though christmas eve is surely not their busiest day )  .   the service was excellent; our waitress took a moment to make some suggestions and give us a run-down on lebanese cuisine .  we both ordered pita wraps ,  which came with fries ,  and everything was delightful; the seasoning on the fries was terrific ,  and the wraps themselves were scrumptious .  the meat was tender ,  juicy ,  and flavorful ,  well-accompanied by the tahani dressing and vegetables that were rolled in with it .   to top everything off ,  our waitress was an absolute peach and gave us both some small pieces of baklava to cap off our experience of lebanese food .  the prices are reasonable ,  at $8 . 75 for the most expensive wrap and $12 or so for a dinner platter if i remember correctly .  they have a full bar and a sizable wine list  ( not so for the beer ,  but then again if you want beer there are better places to visit in cleveland )  ,  and the prices are ,  again ,  reasonable .  without a doubt ,  i ' d recommend this place to friends and would visit again should the opportunity arise . 
__label__4 been a regular here for years ,  very friendly staff and drinks come quick considering the volume of ordering during rushes
__label__5 love this place .  good for darts and cheap drinks .    not glamorous or trendy but def worth your time . 
__label__4 truth be told ,  we come here because we have some deal where we get $10 off once per month .   so with that in mind ,  i ' m a fan .   decent selection ,  good service and portion size .   staff is friendly and attentive .   at full price ,  i ' d knock it down half a star . 
__label__1 if you ' re checking out reviews before buying a living social or groupon ,  be warned that it ' s impossible to make an appointment .  no one answers the phone .  ever .  and they rarely return phone messages .  i know two people whose vouchers expired because they just couldn ' t get an appointment .  i like to support local business ,  but that ' s just poor customer service . 
__label__2 been back a few times so i wanted to edit my review .  the phenomenal massage / facial i received was from a girl who is no longer employed there .  had my nails done two days ago and they already look horrible .  need redone .  they were also not shaped well .  got an eyebrow wax i ' m not crazy about .  they also kept badgering me about if i had a groupon .  i did not ,  so when it came time to pay they seemed to just make up a price .  it was pretty high too !  overall i would say i like the atmosphere but i ' m not coming back .  too bad because i like to support local businesses . 
__label__1 i should have known by how short and rude they were on the phone that this wasn ' t going to be the place for me .  when i arrived i was barely greeted and i got the feeling i was bothering them by being there .  my stylist did not introduce herself to me the entire time  ( i was there for 2 hours for a cut and color )  ,  did not offer a beverage ,  ask if she could set my purse somewhere so it sat awkwardly next to me in the chair for the entire appointment ,  etc .  during my consult i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she was absolutely rude and condescending .  she told me we weren ' t on the same page with what we thought were highlights and different coloring techniques .  .  .  i didn ' t think the customer had to know all the lingo when dealing with a "professional stylist" .  .  .  who turned out to be a the owner .  she did not attempt to make conversation or make me feel comfortable or welcomed the whole time .  icing on the cake is that my hair did not turn out a thing like what i showed her and the color is awful .  i have to admit the cut is good ,  but not good enough to redeem this bad experience . 
__label__1 this is perhaps the worst place at cle .  latte machine broken ,  the regular coffee is weak and more like tea ,  service is slow and unfriendly bordering on hostile .  the bagel with egg i bought was good ,  but i would honestly pay double for a less tasty bagel at a decent place ,  than ever visit this dump ever again .  it was _that_ bad .  do yourself a favor and go to the bagel place at the other end of the terminal ,  they have friendly service ,  good coffee and great bagels . 
__label__5 one of my favorite foods: their pizza bagels !  i actually run the facebook page because i loved it so much !  see you guys at end of aug to get my fix : ) 
__label__5 nice store with a good amount of running shoes ,  apparel ,  etc .   the staff has been friendly to me when i ' ve gone over .   they also have race handouts / books etc for things happening in the area ,  which is good for when you ' re in the area .   it ' s kind of hidden in a strip mall ,  but it ' s definitely a good place to come to for running needs !  ! 
__label__1 worst installation ever !   installers did major damage to brand new kitchen hardwood floors and the company will not repair or even acknowledge that they have a responsibility . 
__label__5 it pleased me immensely to learn that cleveland had a hostel ,  but it made all the better to find out that it was such a great hostel !  the rooms are clean ,  the kitchen and eating area is great ,  and the roof top deck is an awesome addition .  it is right in ohio city ,  a wonderfully walkable neighborhood with bars ,  breweries ,  west side market ,  and easy access to downtown .  the were many little things that also added many a plus for me: chalkboard paint on eating area walls ,  doors made into tables ,  and other creative touches .  if i have one complaint ,  it is that the kitchen needs to be a little better prepared ,  i . e .  towels and coffee filters  ( they do provide coffee and coffee maker )  .  it is possible that at this point they have updated all this .  side note ,  sunset and sunrise from the rooftop deck are both nice experiences ! 
__label__5 clean ,  in a charming part of ohio city ,  and spacious common area .  i couldn ' t believe cleveland had a hostel like this ,  i am highly surprise  ( in a great way )  .  $27 a night for dorm style sleeping ,  or $60+ for a private room ,  it is very affordable for the common backpacker .  the rooftop deck was a great place to relax after an all day romping through the rock & roll hall of fame .   highly recommended ! 
__label__5 the cleveland hostel was outstanding .  so new and hip .  i got a private hostel room at 1 / 2 the price of a cheap hotel .  the hostel had a great view of the city ,  a full service kitchen ,  and offered great deals to area attractions to their patrons .   ( disclaimer- check with the hostel to see when the "quiet time" starts .  it was 10pm for this one , 
__label__5 this is my second time here and i was again impressed .  i love the feel of this small restaurant ,  small bar with maybe 10 or so tables inside .  it ' s got a very old school feel to it ,  and vinyl night ,  tuesday night helps ,  when you can bring your own or pick from their selection .  additionally ,  of course there is a jukebox inside .  i ' ve only ever tried the pierogis ,  but that ' s enough because they are that delicious .  we had the special corned beef pierogis with thousand island dressing ,  i will go ahead and say these were the best pierogis i ' ve ever had and i ' ve had my share !  secondly we had the seasoned beef ,  potatoes ,  carrots and onion pierogi with sour cream ,  it was good ,  like beef stew in a pierogi ,  i would for sure order them again .  i can ' t specifically remember the ones we had the last time ,  but i know they were amazing !  they have other things on the menu my group tried and enjoyed .  so i highly recommend stopping in ,  happy hour is a perfect time to give this place a try and it goes until 9pm on tuesday ' s ! 
__label__3 i went here with a friend on a saturday night around 9 pm .  the patrons were mostly people sitting down for table service .  we sat at a table and ordered a beer and the buffalo chickpea peirogis .  our server was nice and attentive .  when our order came out ,  i was surprised that the peirogis were so small for their price ,  $7 ,  and were served in a disposable dish .  the flavor was good ,  just not enough food .  i ' ll be back to enjoy the space ,  but will hesitate to order food again . 
__label__5 jukebox just opened last night in a neighborhood with a made up name .  they call it hingetown .  i refuse to call this area that name .  it was a cozy little bar .  most customers were nice .  the bar takes recommendations for the jukebox .  customers get a token or two with each drink order to play a song on the box .  this might be the only bar in cleveland that will have mobb deep on the jukebox which is reason enough to show up .  the draft list is mostly midwestern and was impressive .  jolly pumpkin oro de calabaza was $6 .  a back and front patio is coming soon .  brick walls create a nice cavernous bar area .  i can imagine drinking here alone and listening to townes van zandt to pass my time . 
__label__4 super chill place to have a few drinks .  i went on a saturday afternoon and there was a nice crowd at the time .  very comfortable seating and feel with a nice bar area to watch a game where things aren ' t too crazy .  there are a decent amount of different drafts  ( we went during cleveland beer week and i tried a few i have never had .  )  our server gave us tokens for the jukebox-- very fun idea .  i had dinner reservations already for that night ,  or else i would have tried their pierogis .  i had no idea they even served food but they have a wide variety of different pierogis to try and they are only 3 for $7 .  i can ' t wait to go back and try them with a delicious draft ! 
__label__5 "im going to show my concentration and above all supreme body control ,  mike .   i ' ve been working out with my good friend fuji hakayito"  super dave osbourne quote sums up exactly what i was thinking when i stopped here for the first time on a wednesday night .   place may be my new hangout and venue to invite women to a arm wrestling challenge .    sick beer selection and a jukebox that makes me chub up .   mike the bearded bartender is super nice and actually talks to patrons  ( unlike most people in the area )  .   the jukebox get rotated on the 1st of every month im told .   i played iron maiden ,  tribe called quest and tom waits all in one rotation .   that is awesome .   i think the juke only takes the tokens the bartenders give you so some indie buttrocker or a deftones dick cant take up 2 hours of music .   why do people who always listen to the shittiest music always play it loudest and for longest periods of time at bars ?    now back to my training with fuji .  .  . i would love to see:  black sabbath- black sabbath house party- soundtrack saints- sacred saints hall n oats- any x ray spex- germfree adolescents tom waits- heart of saturday night rudy rae moore- sensuous black man hasil adkins- poultry in motion gang starr- daily operations redd foxx- wash yo ass bootsie collins- ahh .  .  .  the name is bootsy ,  baby !  acdc- back in black public enemy- fear of a black planet
__label__4 this place is sweet !  i tried their special sandwich of the day - veggie grilled cheese .  it had cheese ,  spinach ,  tomatoes ,  and lots more delicious veggies .  the sandwiches are huge so you ' ll definitely have some left overs !  can ' t wait to try more sandwiches and soups from this place . 
__label__4 la bodega is great !  the sandwiches are wonderful ,  and i ' m glad that they survived the gas explosion ,  and came back strong !    i ' ve tried many sandwiches and have been happy with each one !   #27  ( turkey ,  smoked gouda ,  balsamic mayo )  is amazing ,  as are all of their chicken salad varieties ranging from curry to sun dried tomato . 
__label__4 decent little dive to grab a sandwich or pasta salad .  my fav is the cran-mayo dressing on the turkey sandwich . 
__label__4 the menu here is huge ,  and they have a great vegetarian selection :d i ' ve had a few hummus wraps ,  you can live on one for about a week ,  they are huge .  today i got the #63 grilled swiss ,  mozzarella ,  provolone plain  ( they usually put tomato ,  onion  , spinach ,  and mayo )  and when i got back to work i noticed it was not plain .  i called up expecting to have to go back to pick up a new sandwich ,  but the girl offered to deliver it right to me .  she also gave me an extra bag of chips and a cookie .  so great !  the #63 is ooey and gooey and just super delicious .   they also have the best balsamic vinaigrette i ' ve ever tasted and the most divine homemade croutons !    ( ps my review is for the la bodega on superior that just opened up not the tremont location ) 
__label__5 sooooo goooood !    i love eating here !  every time i feel like i am spoiling myself with their delicious sandwiches !  today i had the #43 ,  bacon cheese and tomato ,  a little on the simple side i know ,  but thats the kind of mood i was in .  .  . the sandwich was perfect !  the cheeses perfectly metled ,  the bread precisely pressed .  i also had a cup of the chicken and rice soup ,  which was a little underwhelming but still good .  .  .   my boyfriend and i also shared some monstrous rice crispy treat which was topped with marshmallow ,  chocolate and butterfinger candy .  .  . not as delicious as i had hoped but the sandwich more than made up for the not so delish sides     the deco inside is cute ,  metal chairs with some bar seating ,  small tables with grade-school-esqe flair ,  exposed bricks and silly art by the signguy .  comfy atmosphere without being over bearing and stuffy .     i would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a good hearty sandwich !    ps: they has also have a large vegetarian menu with equally delicious and creative sandwiches ! 
__label__2 i don ' t see how this place has such rave reviews .  went the other day -- i got some pita with hummus & veggies .  boyfriend got some turkey sandwich .  he commented that the turkey was poor quality -- mine tasted like stale crusty pita overloaded with tasteless muddy hummus .  we ate there and both had a stomach ache before even finishing our sandwiches .  we tossed over half of our order .  needless to say ,  i will not be back . 
__label__3 good little sandwich place in tremont ,  but we were not overwhelmed .  the bread was delicious ,  but the sandwiches were overpriced .  i had a greek sub with no turkey on it and requested additional veggies instead ,  and i got a paltry piece of lettuce and like seven sprouts .  i paid the same as what someone would pay with turkey which would have been fine if i had gotten more of the green stuff .  there was a cooler that had lots of bottled beverages and i had some really stellar tea .  probably won ' t be in a hurry to go back . 
__label__1 haven ' t been there in months ,  yet they still charged me .  i went in for a refund and they refused it and said they should charge me for another month .    charge me for services in not even using ?   not to mention way over priced .   $35 a month ,  when other local businesses only charge $20 a month .    the whole place was rude !  !  !  they shouldn ' t even get 1 star !  !  !  !  !  ! 
__label__5 hands down best nail salon in cleveland !  everyone there is very talented in nail art ,  and up to date on the latest trends .  i recommend erica ,  i always leave with incredible nail designs and quality acrylics that last without chipping or breaking . 
__label__5 every time i stop at the exchange i am greeted with smiles and words of help .  the staff is always friendly and willing to explain any questions you may have .  prices are fairly competitive to other stores .  i recommend trying here before going anywhere else . 
__label__4 i have only one demand when visiting the better half ' s hometown -- if we ' re going to be in cleveland ,  i need at least one trip to the exchange .   a trove of cheap used cds ,  dvds and games ,  i ' m guaranteed to drop a significant amount of dough when i visit ,  but i ' m also guaranteed to walk out with more swag than i can easily carry .   honestly ,  i don ' t know what i ' d do if i had one of these nearby; any savings would probably be undone by the sheer amount of shopping i ' d do there -- no easy feat when you consider the exchange ' s often rock-bottom prices . 
__label__5 amazing shop ,  friendly employees .  one of my favorite places to find a gift  ( and usually something for myself too !  )  best finds for me are gloves ,  hats ,  jewelry and purses / bags . 
__label__5 omg - the heritage pork is one of the best things i ever ate !  !  !   real rich pork flavor- well marbled ,  tender and juicy !  !  !  !  !  !   i went 2 times in one week .   pan fry the chop in cast iron skillet with salt and pepper- nothing else needed .  simply delish  ,  i also picked up some red cabbage and potatoes .   wow !  !   i will be back next week
__label__1 ghetto .  inside of the place is ramshackle offices with a garage .  lot is tiny .  car selection minimal .  never going back .  how has this place been here so long ?  ! 
__label__2 salon changed hands 12 / 2014 .  the new owners bring their young children to the salon .  only the owner and his wife are friendly and do a good job .    i went in because my regular nail tech was out for a few months .   i won ' t go back
__label__1 wish i had read these other yelp reviews before i made a living social purchase .    several phone calls yielded zero response .   i contacted living social and received a refund .     in my opinion ,  do not patronize this business if you expect a professional response .   they will be out of business before the year is out ,  no doubt . 
__label__4 zachary ' s family took us her for a nice dinner when we were in town this past weekend .  this place is fan to the cy .  gorgeous and rich colors that ,  yes ,  make you think of brazil .  the seating was cozy and we could actually hear one another speak .    i started with the roasted beet salad featuring yellow and red beets ,  a really nice chevre and frissee .  it is awkward to eat frissee because it ' s so springy and has the tendency to spring out of my mouth .  i also ordered the artichoke fritters ,  planning to share them with the boo .  they were amazing and definitely my favorite thing about the meal .  they are very different from my beloved artichoke fritters at cafe fresco ,  but equally delicious .  i think the plate came with 8 of these creamy fritters .  i was greedy and devoured them all .  for my entree ,  i went with key lime chicken which was one of the best chicken dishes i ' ve had in memory .  it was half a chicken which is a huge portion ,  so z got the leftovers .  the plantains were excellent as well .  great job sergio ' s sarava .  thanks to z ' s parents for taking us there .  mmhmm ! 
__label__5 crazy good food .  exotic imgrediants push you out of your comfort zone .  new .  fresh .  diffrent .  delicious .  if you are looking for a culinary adventure ,  look no further .  upon leaving stuffed with goodness ,  you will be convinced that everything is better with coconut milk . 
__label__1 small portion sizes ,  inconsistent food  ( ordered the same thing but got it completely different )  ,  expensive but poor quality  ( compared to #1 pho )  .   most of all: we ordered take-out and it was fine ,  expensive ,  but we were still a bit hungry .  a week later we decided to go eat there .  first of all ,  they charged $ . 50 / cup of tea when we both ordered it ,  but gave us a kettle .  we were charged to use their cups ?  then when we got a refill ,  they charged us another $1 for the kettle ,  which was just the same tea ball with more water so the tea was watered down and had no taste the second time .  the food was fine ,  the broken rice is ok and the vermicelli is dry ,  but more like a salad .  the beef dishes are mostly fat with very little lean meat .   here ' s the kicker: this is a new business and they decided to start it out by stealing from their new customers .  my receipt was altered by the waiter  ( or someone )  and i was overcharged by $10 .   ( classic adding 1 before the tip amount !  )  .  i contacted the restaurant and was hung up on .  now i have to dispute the amount with my bank and report this place to the police .  if you go here ,  pay with cash !  don ' t use credit or debit cards !    overall: don ' t waste your time .  it ' s overpriced and not good quality .  they stole from me ,  plus charged for water and cups !  go to #1 pho ,  which is superior quality and literally a few steps away .  this place will go out of business very soon .    edit: the bank required me to file a police report against the restaurant in order to reverse the charge .  the police informed me that they are investigating similar claims against the owners for forgery and credit card alteration fraud . 
__label__3 i decided i should try this newly opened vietnamese eatery since i ' ve tried all the others .   the interior is nicely decorated and comfy .   oddly ,  there were no other diners in the restaurant at noon on a friday .   i ' ll start with the things i didn ' t like .    first ,  the door was propped open .  this resulted in several flies walking up and down the inside of the window next to me and occasionally buzzing down around my food .     second ,  the summer rolls ,  while good ,  were not particularly flavorful .   the roast pork in them seemed bland and the only thing i really tasted was the basil .   they came with a peanut based sauce that was thick and topped with more peanuts .     third ,  the com dish  ( broken rice with grilled pork )  didn ' t seem to have any herbs .   there was no cilantro or basil .   the rice was good but i ' ve had better .   the pork appeared to be a thin cut pork chop and while the flavor was good i encountered quite a bit of fat and gristle in the meat .  the dish came with a chopped piece of tomato ,  cucumber and two sauce bowls .   one contained sweet nuoc mam and the other had a light colored broth with some bits of scallion floating in it .   the latter didn ' t seem to have a lot of flavor and tasted almost like a watered down soup of some sort .     the dish did have a nice piece of vietnamese meat-loaf on the plate and this was quite flavorful .     the best part of the meal was the bahn mi which i took back to work .   the flavor was outstanding .   the sauce ,  cilantro and jalapeno were very flavorful .   the size of the sandwich was great for $2 . 95  ( hard to believe )  .     the bread ,  however ,  was uniformly soft rather than having a crusty exterior as i ' ve come to expect from bahn mi .   also ,  the grilled pork had quite a bit of gristle and i found myself removing a couple hard to chew pieces from the sandwich .     in their favor ,  saigon grille has only recently opened so hopefully they ' ll work out some of the kinks . 
__label__3 the bahn mi here is better than superior pho .  .  . but that is probably about it .   the marinated and grilled pork is soooooo flavorful !    i have ordered pad thai twice here and the first time is was good and saucy and the second time .  .  . half of it was dry noodles .   it is a very cute place .   i also like the little altar and incense in the doorway ,  i feel like i am entering a temple or a special place . 
__label__4 my friend turned me onto saigon ,  what a great lunch spot !  their noodle dishes are full of fresh ingredients ,  served by a friendly staff .  the prices are very reasonable for the quality of food and the portion sizes .    the decor is simple but tasteful .  i would definitely recommend for a business lunch or casual get together . 
__label__4 finally i ate at saigon grill which is right next to superior pho .   sorry for a comparison but i cannot help comparing these two restaurants for my review .   saigon grill is little bit more upscale than superior pho .  a bit .  it is clearner and tables and seates are a bit more luxurious .  a bit .   the waitress here are super friendly ,  smiley and welcoming !  it is the opposite of mcdonald ' s / rally ' s staff .     ( banh mi )  omg .  very very good here .  the grilled pork is amazing .  it is only $3 . 75 .  we also order one for take away .     ( vermicelli with grilled pork and shrimp )  i knew this one would be a killer and i was right !  wow ,  the pork was well marinaded and very yum .  this is the same pork in the banh mi .     ( egg noodle )   the soup for egg noodle is dirtier and more intense than pho .  the noodle in this dish was not a highlight tho ,  the soup was very tasty .    ( fried rice with shrimp and vietnamese sausage )  i ' ve never had friend rice in vietnamese style and i was totally imagining something like thai fried rice which is my favorite fried rice but it wasn ' t .  it ' s got all frozen diced peas , carrots and tiny shrimps ,  and green onions and this very sweet vietnamese style sausage ,  and it was seasoned with salt and pepper only .  i could make it !  maybe i didn ' t order a right dish for me .   i will go back there to try their pho and other stuff especially their pork dish are superb ! 
__label__4 i think this place definitely qualifies as a hidden gem .   most of my asian friends have never been here because  ( 1 )  we equate vietnamese food with pho and  ( 2 )  we already have a go-to place for pho - that is ,  superior pho - just down the street .     anyway ,  i happened upon this place the other week .   there wasn ' t much in the way of clientele because ,  as mentioned ,  this was a new restaurant among tough competition .   but either way ,  i was pleasantly surprised .   i didn ' t actually try the pho ,  but this restaurant offers two other vietnamese options that both tasted pretty decent: vermicelli noodle and broken rice dishes .   and similar to pho ,  you can choose different combinations of meat to go into each of these dishes .   i think this place is worth checking out . 
__label__4 this place is very good .  i don ' t always drown myself ,  but when i do it will be in a bowl of pho .   just a warning the large pho is enough for 2 people .   i could barely finish 1 / 2 .  they even have one that is bigger than the large !  enough for a family of 20 !  the broth was typical pho flavor ,  the eye of round and well done brisket were beefy !  .   i jazzed mine with basil ,  rooster sauce ,  lime and bean sprouts .   the noodles were cooked perfectly .   my friend and i split  the pork summer roll .  that pork was cooked perfectly .  very good .  then we split the pork spring roll ,  it was a little underwhelmed .    the service was very friendly .   when i asked the waitress to pack the pho she did not know how to get it in the cup ,  spilled it on the table !  i had to take over !   another solid place in cleveland ' s little china town ! 
__label__2 i ' m gonna keep in simple: come for the grilled food ,  and only if you don ' t mind bad service .  the woman working at the front is seriously one of the rudest people i ' ve ever encountered in a restaurant .  she seems annoyed to even bring over a menu .  her attitude alone set me off to not want to come back .   i have been here multiple times however ,  because my boyfriend loves the grilled pork here .  i have to say that the grilled pork is quite good ,  but for me it doesn ' t quite make up for the bad service  ( especially when the restaurant isn ' t even that busy during an average lunch hour )  .   pho is nothing special ,  and a bit expensive compared to the other places around .  me and my friend both ordered the lunch special for 10 . 95  ( a bowl of pho ,  a soda ,  and two spring rolls )  which wouldn ' t be a bad deal except his bowl was literally twice as filled as mine was when they brought it out .  when i inquired the server as to why this was ,  he explained that it was because he had ordered the special .  i ignored the fact that we had both ordered the special and waved it off as a miscommunication .  .  . funny when i got the bill ,  they made no mistake about charging us both for the special .  safe to say i will not be back anytime soon . 
__label__2 let ' s be honest if you ' re my age and you ' re at liquid on a saturday night you ' re probably going to hate it .    the drinks are overpriced and the place is crowded .   ( bumble bumble old guy things )  .    you ' re probably not even reading a yelp review if you ' re planning on going here .  i just haven ' t yelped in a while and figured i would throw one up here for my activity this weekend .  being here was not one of my brightest moments . 
__label__5 mike lucas is the sexiest bartender in the world .   think pedophile mixed with car mechanic .  .  .  .  that ' s his rustic look .   you ' ll fall in love . 
__label__5 best place in tower city for ppl working tower city office bldgs .  you ' ll get yummy and healthy soups .  i bet u visited couple of more times after ur first visit .  i love chicken and dumpling ,  paprikashi ,  veg chilli and black beans soups . 
__label__4 my girls came downtown to have lunch with me .  this was our first time eating there .  the staff were nice but not very helpful and were either clueless or were not willing to tell us about their menu .  our food was good and the service was quick ,  but is was not really memorable .  i had an egg salad sandwich and a cup of clam chowder .  i will comeback again to have lunch but when my girls come downtown to eat with me i think we will check out east 4th . 
__label__5 one of my absolute favorite soup places downtown !  the fact that i work in tower city makes this place the best in the fall ,  winter or spring when the weather isn ' t so great outside .  their options of soups are incredible and each of the ones i ' ve tried have been delicious .  their salads and sandwiches are huge for the price .  the service is always so quick and everyone working there is very friendly .    there is nothing better than the tomato tortellini soup with a grilled cheese sandwich on a rainy cold day .  or a fresh spinach salad on a hot summer day .    i haven ' t tried anything here that i haven ' t fallen in love with and the price is very reasonable . 
__label__1 being a former employee "back in the day , " best buy as a company has gone down hill ,  and this store is no exception .   i try to avoid it at all costs ,  but once in a while i ' ll get a good e-mail offer and try to go and redeem it only to have the employees say it doesn ' t apply or won ' t ring up or that i ' ve used it before when i haven ' t .   what ' s worse is how rude the management is .   first you have teens running the store at all levels ,  including management and when there is an issue ,  the management comes to the front and talks with the employee insulting the customer where they can hear them and then walk away .   do these people forget that customers are the ones with the $$ which will help their business ?   things in this store were different back in 2008-2009 ,  but after a few management changes ,  it seems like the store continues to get worse . 
__label__1 actually ,  best buy is incredibly lame .   employees know very little about anything outside of their little section of the store .  they are friendly but generally unable to help with any except giving directions in the store .  of course ,  best buy is cheap perhaps because so little is done to train their employees .   also ,  never ever take them up on their extended warranty pitch - it ' s a huge money maker for the store and it offers the customer very little .  see this article: http: /  / www . smartmoney . com / spending / deals / extended-warranty-rip-offs-17820 / 
__label__3 definitely the least douchey of any best buy i ' ve been to ,  which is why i keep going back .  they do have some great deals on dvds and blu-ray discs which rotate often .  i mean ,  i ' ll always check buybacks first ,  but if i ' m a browsing mood ,  and there ' s nothing but old keeping up appearances disc sets and sappy hugh grant movies at buybacks ,  i ' ll mosey on over to best buy to see what they ' ve got .   cara got the customer service part right too .  they aren ' t over the top ,  but they are always there if you need something .  and the return / exchange process is in fact great ,  which is always good during ,  and after ,  the holidays .   ( or ,  like ,  whenever .  )   we did tv shopping here last year .  the guy was patient as they come ,  because we were clearly inept at deciding what we liked or wanted .  another staff member explained to us the pros and cons of various netbooks  ( this was pre-ipad madness )  when we were interested in purchasing one .   one thing i ' d never get here is a phone ,  though .  the phone section always sketches me out for some reason and has too many options .  also ,  if you go at the wrong time ,  you can get stuck hearing annoying renditions of "don ' t wanna miss a thing" as people partake of the free rock band trial  ( why do people always have to do karaoke when they see it ?   why can ' t they just leave it alone ?  )  but other than that ,  best buy is pretty good . 
__label__5 any and every dewey ' s i ' ve been to has been wonderful from the service to the food .  some of my favorites are the candied walnut and grape salad and the green lantern pizza .  also ,  there ' s the cuban pizza monthly special - to die for !  this is a ohio chain i love to support ! 
__label__5 this pizza is so good .  i went here with my mom after work and the environment was really chill and relaxing and the servers were really nice too .  their pizzas are innovative without being too much .  definitely pizzas are worth trying they give a nice twist on the usual toppings and you get to try something new : ) 
__label__4 we had the house salad and a bronx bomber .   the house salad is delicious .  pine nuts ,  cranberries ,  and goat cheese - in addition to a beautiful vinaigrette .  it ' s a 5-star salad .   the bronx bomber is good ,  but not out of this world .  it ' s a solid pizza ,  but nothing i would rave about - maybe 3 . 5 stars .    oddly enough ,  go to dewey ' s for the salad ,  not the pizza . 
__label__4 as far as gourmet pizza goes ,  this is the best tasting that i have ever had .   the crust is just right ,  the ingredients taste fresh ,  and the pizza is not soaked with grease .   i love that they allow you to get specialty half and half pizzas so you can try two different types of pizzas in one pizza and they let you swap out ingredients .   i love out minced garlic for swapping roasted whole garlic and mozzarella cheese for goat cheese whenever possible ,  delicious !   their salads are also phenomenal ,  and even though i know i am going to gorge myself on pizza ,  i always end up ordering salad too because they taste that good .   my sister loves their parmesan cheese and i swear ,  she pours the whole container on her pizza; to each their own !   this place is great for kids because they can watch the pizza-makers toss and make the pizzas through a window and they always enjoy this .   my kids never seem to tire of this entertainment .   every time i have been to this location ,  i have never had to wait for a table ,  but the parking lot next is very small so spaces are usually a problem .   the only other dewey ' s that i have been to in dayton was horribly packed and the wait was more than an hour on a saturday evening; pretty much a nightmare and reminded me of the chaos of the cheesecake factory waits .   therefore ,  this cleveland location is my preferred dewey ' s so far and whenever i am up visiting my sister ,  i always request a trip to get some garlic ,  goat cheese ,  and mushrooms on an awesome pizza at dewey ' s . 
__label__4 good pizza ,  but would like the crust to be a little thinner .  some of the specials are worth trying even though they sound a little odd .  the flavors they put together seem to work .  good service and reasonable prices . 
__label__5 such a cute ,  comfortable place to have a coffee .  i brought my laptop in to edit photos and enjoyed a latte .  the staff was also very friendly . 
__label__5 what a hidden gem .  i grew up in this neighborhood and never stopped by until today .  i was very impressed with the wide variety of tea and coffee selections at such an inexpensive price !  they also had a menu of lunch / dinner options ,  nuts ,  candies and baked goods available .  while i cannot attest to the taste ,  they sure looked and sounded delightful .  very laid back atmosphere and excellent customer service ! 
__label__5 i love using uber !  i ' ve always had great experiences with the drivers ,  they always arrive when the app says they will ,  they ' re usually as talkative and friendly and you want them to be ,  and i ' ve always paid a reasonable amount of money .  taking these cars to and from the airport is cheaper ,  more fun ,  and more reliable than taking a cab in my opinion .  i once got stood up by a cab i called for a trip to the airport ,  and an uber arrived literally 5 minutes after i call it .  i ' m not sure what the wait times are for people who live outside of the city ,  but the longest i ' ve ever waited for one downtown is 6 minutes- and that ' s any time of the day or night- which is amazing !  !  i ' ve used their promo a lot where my friends have used my code on their first ride ,  making theirs free and giving me 20 dollars towards my next ride !   also ,  they say you don ' t have to tip and for some reason when i first started taking uber i thought it was some policy like aveda where you ' re not supposed to tip- but that ' s not true .  you just can ' t add it to your card !  you can tip your little heart out in cash if you wish to do so !    so far ,  uber has not wronged me and i will continue to use them until they do
__label__2 i ' m shocked at how quickly a rating can change .    5 of us stopped in recently to check out the band and get some food .  i had been looking forward to this all week- i ' m not kidding .  there are always so many things on the menu and i was looking forward to trying something new .  they were nice and busy ,  so we waited about 20 minutes for a table .  when i finally feasted my eyes upon the menu .  .  .  .  i was so bummed .  the menu has changed drastically and none of the things i wanted to try were on it .  in fact ,  there was literally nothing on the menu i wanted to consider for dinner .  how does that happen ?  i ' m certainly not that picky .   after grumbling a bit ,  i settled on a salad ,  lobster bisque soup  ( special )  and pierogies .  the salad ,  thankfully ,  hasn ' t changed .  it ' s still pretty and their house dressing is delicious .  the pierogi were smothered in too many red onions ,  but once i slid those off .  .  .  there were pillowy ,  full and delicious pierogies underneath .  the lobster bisque soup was disappointing .  it had no lobster chunks at all and tasted like canned soup .  i couldn ' t even finish it .    our service was okay ,  but i felt like we were ignored because they knew we were staying to hear the band .  i started off with a beer ,  but the service was too slow to keep it going so i switched to soda .   i know they have the same cook ,  so i ' m not sure why all the changes but i hope they ' ll update their menu and give me something to come back to ! 
__label__1 my husband and i have been here on a week night once before service and food were good .  loved the homemade french onion chip dip  ,  however we went on friday night and he had the "fish fry special" he asked if the fish was heavily coated and was told no .  when the dish came out it was clearly baked or broiled fish no batter involved .  he stopped  the waitress and explained that this was not what he wanted .  she then went on describing each item that came with the dinner .  we could clearly see what was on the plate our issue was with the fish .  she then obnoxiously yelled for the manager .  the manager handled the issue in tip top mgr style ,  however the waitress would not let it go .  my husband explained he was not trying to be a pain but she continued to argue that it was what he ordered and that he yelled at her  ( didn ' t happen )   she was getting other customers involved as to why she was right and my husband was wrong while we were sitting right there .  needless to say it was now uncomfortable for us so i got a box to go    the night was not a total wash out as we went to bonnie ' s down the street ! 
__label__5 tonight was my boyfriends birthday and i wanted to do something special for his birthday so we sat at the chefs table .  john was the chef tonight and did an amazing job of taking care of us .  our guacamole and chips were fresh and tasted delicious !  !  john also did an amazing job of explaining how he was preparing other foods .   we also got a chance to sample other items on the menu that we have not tried before .  our main entrees of trout and scallops were spot on .   to top it all off we ended with fried ice cream !  !  it was an amazing night and we can ' t wait to experience the chefs table with john again !  ! 
__label__4 heard about momocho last year while watching a diners ,  drive-ins and dives marathon on the food network .  i was intrigued and made sure that if i ever went to cleveland ,  i would check it out .  and - it was so worth it .  i would drive to cleveland for the crab-corn-chile chipotle guacamole alone !    we were told when we made our reservations that it would be a "two hour dining experience" and that it was !   the servers never rushed us and their recommendations were excellent !  i had the avocado leaf crusted tuna  /  blood orange-jalapeno marmelada taquitos - though a bit skeptical about the blood orange-jalapeno marmelade ,  by the end of thet meal i was literally licking the bowl clean .  the key to momocho is that they combine fabulous protiens with these incredible sauces - and if you ' re eating in a group ,  nothing should stop you from trying other sauces !  : )    note on portion sizes - the portions are more than adequate and if you combine the entree with some guacamole ,  you will be stuffed !  we were so stuffed that we couldn ' t even look at the dessert menu - though we vowed to come back !    overall - a+ ! 
__label__4 went here a few weeks ago ,  because i had had some of their stuff to go and really liked it .  i ended up ordering something different than i intended ,  and did not like id that much  ( too much lime )  .  i did really like their queso fundito .  i honestly think i just made a bad choice for my lkiing ,  and definitely would go back again . 
__label__5 i get the lamb tamales every time i go because first i don ' t go too often but second they are freaking awesome !  !  !  also the margarita sampler is delicious and very versatile in the dynamic of the flavors ! 
__label__4 so ,  i tried making a reservation for is place and was surprised that fridays were pretty booked unless you wanted a 9:30 pm reservation (  who wants that ?  ?  )   well ,  they have a gorgeous patio ,  but unfortunately it closed right after i walked in as they were having a  ' slow night ' c bummer cos it was a gorgeous day in cleveland !  !   we started off with some margaritas .  .  oh my !   i had the blood orange  .  .  it was so good and not too sweet ,  my friend had the spicy mango that was so good ,  if you ' ve had the mango indian drink ,  maaza before ,  it ' s kinda like with tequila and spice .  . : )  .  .    on to the food .  .  we had the chipotle ,  crab and corn guacamole .  .  .  delicious .  .  very good !  !  .  .   i had the shrimp which was good but mediocre and my friend ad the machacha briske which was way better .  .  we ended with another round of margheritas .  . i the strawberry mint which was okay and my friend the hibiscus !  !  !  omg  .  .  so good .  .  (  i obviously ordered the wrong things  .  . : )  )  .  .  all in all it was a good meal .  .  our waiter was friendly and made some good suggestions !  !  .  the bartender was awesome is he charged my dead i phone and when i walked over to the bar  .  .  he just handed it to me .  .  didn ' t even have to ask .  .  and that my friends is service !  i will definitely go back ! 
__label__5 excellent mod mex !  pretty long wait to get in ,  but worth every second .  the margaritas are very well made and delicious !  we frequented the sister restaurant ,   ' el carnicero '  ,  in lakewood because it was a shorter drive and were equally impressed . 
__label__3 first and foremost ,  i want to say that i absolutely love that there ' s a resale shop in coventry !  i should also say that i haven ' t tried to sell any clothes at avalon ,  i ' ve only shopped there  ( though some of these reviews make me think it ' d be a good idea to try !  )   the first couple of times i went into avalon ,  i was amazed .  i probably spent about an hour in there ,  looking around ,  trying things on ,  etc .  i liked that they had some typical name brand attire ,  as well as some unique ,  edgy things .  i can find a cardigan for work ,  a dress for an 80 ' s party ,  and a cute skirt all in one fell swoop !   unfortunately ,  avalon seems to have lost its novelty .  it seems to me like the clothes aren ' t switched out very often .  the last few times i ' ve been in there ,  i ' ve recognized clothes from previous shopping trips .  i don ' t go in all that often ,  so i would think there would be some new things each time i go in .  while i found some things to purchase the first few times i was there ,  i haven ' t had much luck recently .   i wish they had a bigger jewelry section ,  too .  i feel like avalon would have really cute jewelry that i ' d be interested in buying ,  but the same has held true; it seems like it ' s the same couple of necklaces each time i go in .    hopefully avalon is on the upswing .  i really love the idea ,  and i ' d love to visit the store more frequently !  but with the nature of how often the clothes are changed ,  i think i ' ll have to delay my next visit for a while . 
__label__4 make reservations and prepare to have an amaaaaazing meal .  it ' s definitely a place to experience out of this world spicy margaritas and sexy lighting .  fantastic for a date night . 
__label__5 this was a great restaurant to stop and eat at while i was in cleveland .  and i think it may have been the reason i ' ve been converted to a guacamole lover .   the restaurant is located in the trendy ohio city neighborhood .  we came here on the recommendation of my brother in law ,  who had been here before .  it certainly didn ' t disappoint !    we started with the guacamole appetizer which had three different types of guacamole .  we got a spicy guacamole ,  a blue cheese guacamole ,  and a goat cheese guacamole .  i know .  these all sound very gross ,  but i assure you ,  they were divine !  i especially loved the goat cheese guacamole .    we also got a salsa appetizer .  the salsa here is fresh and the chips are delicious .  not too salty ,  and they didn ' t get soggy when coming in contact with the salsa which is key to a good chips and salsa experience .    i ordered the scallops for dinner and they were pretty delicious .  i loved the sauce they put the scallops in .    the service was on point here .  the water cups were endlessly refilled and our server was very friendly and answered any questions we had .    definitely a great spot for mexican food .  in cleveland ! 
__label__5 one of the best spots in cleveland ,  hands down .   recommend trying the crab or goat cheese guac .   don ' t eat too much of it or you ' ll never make it to dinner .   check out the wild boar ,  coffee braised beef or scallop entrees .   oh and make sure you wash it all down with a  ( or 3 )  custom margarita . 
__label__5 the cook\chef - top notch .  everything i saw come out of that kitchen looked delectable .  i would go back just to try everything on the menu at least once .  i overate gormet guac and indulged in some savory wild boar ,  so delicious !  !  ! 
__label__5 the atmosphere and food are amazing !  staff is friendly and knowledgeable .  you can tell that the food is made with fresh ,  quality ingredients .  it ' s well worth it .  they ' re cocktails are also fantastic !  just make sure you call ahead to make a reservation because they tend to get pretty busy . 
__label__5 we started the night off with chips and guacamole .   they were both freshly made and did not last long at the table .   for the main dish i got a beef brisket and my wife got mahi mahi .   the brisket had a little heat .   the fish was grilled and very light .   the only regret we had was not having enough time for dessert ! 
__label__5 mod mexican ,  i am impressed .   they redeveloped mexican classics into creative dishes ,  and ended up being more authentic then 99% of the restaurants in the area .  it was great to see a place be mod ,  but lose none of the integrity or flavor of what the dish is representing ,  ok a little dizzy from all the circles .   when the first dish spins your sombrero around ,  you know you are in for something special .   the guacamole sauce is rich and smooth ,  but with enough chunk to give it a heaviness .   so the lifting of this dip will getting well on the way to being fit for your lucha libre dibut .   my dinner was carnitas  /  adobo braised pork  /  honey-chipotle mojo .   the squares of pork fell apart with ease .   creamy honey-chipotle sauce coating every bite .   also the sauce was more about the taste then the fire .   hey there ' s tortillas so i can have some guac on my meat also !   the decor of the place ties together 2 of my favorite latin culture items .   dieda de los muertos and  ( big announcer voice here )  el mie1s fantie1sticos entretienen la atracciif3n del mundo de la lucha libre .   thanks momocho ,  and see you soon ,  viva mexico ! 
__label__2 tried the korean bbq beef tacos at motormouth .   $8 for 2 tacos--about the same size as the tacos you would get at chipotle--filled with grilled steak ,  hoison bbq sauce ,  shredded lettuce ,  cucumber kimchi ,  and table cream .   i liked the corn tortillas and the relatively sizable strips of grilled steak ,  but the taste overall was underwhelming .   the cucumber kimchi did not add much ,  as the flavor was primarily driven by the hoison sauce which is then dulled down by the cream .   the effort was appreciated ,  but the tacos are a little too pricey for what you get--i would definitely opt for another one of the menu items should i visit again .   the line and wait for food took about five minutes total towards the end of the lunch hour .   the wind whipping down east 9th made certain that i felt every second of those five minutes .   if you have to trek back to your office before eating ,  ask for some foil to cover your basket of food . 
__label__5 first time i visited was st .  patty ' s day .  i had the corned beef burger .  hand ground patty ,  cabbage ,  thousand island ,  so tender and juicy .  i don ' t know how it stayed together ,  but it was amazing and a great size for the price .  here ' s hoping this gets added to the menu on a regular rotation .   service is fast and friendly ,  food is fresh and delicious with some inventive twists .  the grilled cheese is amazing - cheddar and blue cheese together on toasty bread - the perfect comfort food .   my friend swears by the beef tacos .  and don ' t forget a mexican brownie !  spicy and sweet ,  just a little exotic and a great end to a good meal .   of all the food trucks ,  this one is probably my favorite and am excited to see what delicious ideas they come up with next . 
__label__5 seriously ~ there is no need to support the big box retailers when you have a local shop that can provide you with their same pricing ,  if not better .   plus ,  the owner steve is a great guy .   he can help you out with any questions you might have on any of the video games .   i have bought my boyfriend several ps3 games from here .    also ,  i can ' t help but shop for myself when i am in .   he also sells blu-rays ,  dvd ' s and boxed sets at some excellent deals .    my favorite find has been the box set of the classic cartoons of pink panther .   i have not seen that in any of the stores ,  so that made my christmas .     i highly recommend shopping at this location -- buy local !  !  !    you will not regret !  !  !  ! 
__label__2 i like abc tavern in ohio city ,  and xyz tavern in detroit-shoreway .  their service isn ' t always top-notch ,  but it ' s not terrible .  unfortunately ,  i found the abc uptown to be extremely disappointing when i visited there on sunday ,  september 13th .  the place was pretty empty ,  and our service reflected the staff ' s boredom .  our server rarely checked on our table ,  which caused a couple of folks in our party to go to the bar to buy their drinks ,  where they saw our server on her phone several times .  we had a double order come out from the kitchen and of course one order missing because of what was obviously a mix-up .  i had the burger ,  and it was just ok .  it lacked flavor and the tomatoes were sliced ridiculously thick .  i ' ll stick to the west side locations ,  where at least i get half-way decent service sometimes . 
__label__4 okay ,  let me start by saying i ' m not a "bar guy" .  i don ' t drink regularly ,  but when i do go for a beer and some conversation ,  i like a place that feels .  .  . comfy .   abc the tavern near case western reserve university  is that old ,  semi-worn couch of a bar that you love to go to just relax a bit ,  talk ,  and have a drink and some solid food that will definitely satisfy .  the place  has personality to spare .  i ' m not sure where they got the actual ,  physical bar at ,  but it looks to be quite old and classic looking .  the place has a worn look to it already ,  even though it has not ,  as far as i know ,  physically been there that long .    however ,  you ' d never know it hadn ' t been there forever .  it is a bit loud ,  but the company and the conversation are good all around .    the drinks are decent and diverse ,  and the food ,  which is anything but typical ,  includes a shark sandwich ,  the bacon wrapped ,  jalapeno-stuffed atomic dog ,  and there ' s even selections for the vegetarian like the hummus / cucumber club sandwich and a filet of tofu .    another funny element; when your order is up at the kitchen window ,  the cook ,  who appeared to be one of the toughest ladies i ' ve ever seen ,  rings a full gong .  .  . so if you have a nervous condition ,  eh ,  you might want to sit as far from that as possible: )  for everyone else ,  you will be very awake when your food comes: )    ( btw ,  let me qualify this; the cooks at this place are awesome ,  toughness and all .  this is not just bar food ,  it ' s exceptional bar food !  : )   another difficulty ,  which is found all over university circle ,  is the parking .  .  . or lack thereof .  there are numerous garages in the area ,  including a close one on ford and some parking behind the buildings on euclid ,  but  it ' s still tight no matter where you try to bivouac your vehicle .    i ' m also sure that ,  due to proximity ,  this place was created to cater a lot to the cwru populace ,  but if you care to come down ,  it ' s a nice little spot for some animated conversation ,  some good food ,  and a great place to re-learn your a-b-c ' s: ) 
__label__2 it was great when it first open .  only a one good employee .  was nearly done eating by the time i got water .  the server was rude and the bar tender that took our order was rude .  all 6 of us were not happy with the service and the food is simple so you really can ' t mess up .  but shitty services really ruins an experience .  i ask an employee about something on the menu and he said " i don ' t eat this food because it is nasty a** f**k" i asked him if he was joking and he said he was serious .  he hated everything on the menu .  in my opinion that ' s not very professional and kind of odd to talk so lowly of a place you work .  i won ' t be back unless they get new staffing . 
__label__5 the best thing is the beer ,  the second best thing about this place is the staff .   we ' ve been here twice now and what stands out most is how friendly and knowledgable the staff is .   david ,  our bartender on our most recent visit ,  gave us some great recommendations when he saw what sort of beer we liked to drink and even gave us some samples of other beers to try in the future .   the place feels great inside but i can ' t wait to see what the patio is like in the summer ,  it ' s a huge space .   we were told that they have live music on the weekends but we have missed it on both of our weekday visits ,  would like to check that out too . 
__label__3 great neighborhood bar located in cleveland .  the space has been recently renovated with a great copper top bar and exposed brick walls .  we were there thanksgiving weekend so the only downfall i felt was it wasn ' t that busy .  the drinks are affordable and our bartender steve poured a great drink .  great place to listen to the local top 40 and talk and catch up with your friends . 
__label__5 had a craving for pho ,  so i decided to grab some at a new place .  so glad i did !  the service was nice ,  and the food was delicious and plentiful .  i don ' t know what it was about this place ,  but i had an overhwlming sense of cleanliness ,  warmth and comfort ,  as well as a general feeling of well-being .  i couldn ' t put my finger on it ,  but i felt as if i was eating a meal at someone ' s home half way across the world .  perhaps it ' s some really good feng shui goin '  on .  anyway ,  i will totally be back to snag me some pho when coming here to shop next door . 
__label__5 the bun bo hue is great full of flavor and pork meats and herbs .  not sure about the other reviewers previous but i ordered the pho a few days ago and it literally was the pho is the best i ' ve had in cleveland in the last 3 years i ' ve been here  ( pho dac diet had every cut there ,  tripe ,  meatballs brisket )  .  great side of herbs to go with it all .   this restaurant is where i go when i am homesick for my mom ' s vietnamese cooking ! 
__label__4 came here with a reservation for a group of 16 for late lunch on sunday .  a very casual place ,  good vietnamese food .  i got the meal 2 with bahn mi and pho 3 .  the bahn mi was actually very meaty compared to most i ' ve had and has a slight ginger taste .  pho was solid ,  good serving sizes .  servers seemed quite busy but were pretty attentive and service was pretty good .  would come again . 
__label__5 this is pretty much my favorite pizza place now .  i just recently moved to cleveland heights and i am not sure that i will order pizza from anywhere else .   i have only ever ordered for delivery so i cannot comments on their location or seating . 
__label__5 wow ,  pizza bogo has some of the finest pizza in northeast ohio !   in general ,  the pizzas all taste incredibly fresh ,  and the prices are amazing !   it ' s the type of pizza that tastes great while you ' re eating ,  but doesn ' t leave you feeling weighed down when you ' re finished .   additionally ,  the menu is very friendly to those who restrict pork from their diets .   all of the pizzas we ordered were out of this world: bangkok ,  tuscan fiorentina ,  milano ,  napa valley ,  and meat works .   both the original crust and the miracle crust were spectacular .   even the bread stix with marinara and garlic sauce was awesome ,  but i ' d rather eat pizza ! 
__label__5 wow !  the best pizza i ' ve ever had and i ' m from chicago ,  home of the best pizzas in the world .  it ' s strictly a take-out or delivery place and no place to sit other than a few chairs and sofas for people who don ' t call ahead .  i would recommend that you go for your own creative ideas and the unlimited toppings that suits your fancy .  definitely will be back again and again ! 
__label__5 from the moment i contacted michael rubin to three weeks later when both rides were completed ,  customer service was top notch !   the driver he sent to take my sister ,  my dad and myself to airport ,  michael simon was early ,  professional ,  kind ,  very personable ,  and his lexus was spotless !   we cruised comfortably and on time to the airport ,  a great start to our trip !   when it came time for my dad ' s return ,  michael rubin took all my worries about my dad traveling alone  (  he ' s almost 92 !  )  away !   the pickup at the airport and the ride home went perfectly !   he even helped my dad into the house ,  got lights on and settled prior to leaving ,  now that ' s customer service !   i plan to hire simple shuttle any time i need a ride to / from the airport in cleveland ! 
__label__1 this should be called simply useless .   about a month ago i tried to use this service and left several voice mail messages that were never returned .   recently we did get in touch and arranged for transportation but my flight was delayed .   got a text from him saying because of the delay he was unavailable .   he suggested i take a cab .   thanks who needs this guy ? 
__label__5 great service both ways - michael was waiting for us when we got home - definitely forth the price for great door to door service
__label__5 the owner is so nice !  continued conversation for the entire breakfast .  great food and wonderful service .  stop in !  it ' s worth it ! 
__label__5 much smaller than my wife and i expected but they made some great food !  check out the pictures ! 
__label__3 the owner is very friendly .  the food is a little bland and chicken was dry .  the baklava tasted old and stale .  the shawarma is good ! 
__label__3 falafel cafe serves middle eastern takeout food in the heart of case ' s campus .  when i go there ,  i order one of the pita wrap sandwiches .   my favorites are the shistawook  ( grilled chicken with vegetables )  and beef kabob sandwiches .   the falafel sandwich is average .   makanek and kefta sandwiches are good for the price .   not a huge fan of the kebbeh sandwich .   if you are hungry ,  you can buy a combo meal with fries and a soft drink ,  but  the fries are often soggy .   maybe i am just spoiled by the well seasoned ,  crisp fries at wolfgang puck express across the street .    if you ' re looking to take someone to a middle eastern restaurant for dinner ,  i would suggest aladdin ' s .   if you just need a quick bite to eat during the workday and want to have a cheap ,  decent pita sandwich ,  then falafel cafe is not a bad choice .  while i label this as "takeout" food ,  there is ample space to eat inside the restaurant as well . 
__label__4 solid baba - maybe a little too much smoked paprika ?   pretty good though ,  we both enjoyed it .   could definitely taste the eggplant .   the salmon wrap and falafel were both tasty .   the pita was a bit chewy ,  but that ' ll be my only complaint .   the price was right and the service was friendly - i ' d go back . 
__label__4 what an awesome place .   it ' s like heaven for a real g ,  and by real g i mean vegetarian .   tons of choices ,  prompt service ,  cheap pricing .   it ' s definitely more of a fast-food joint ,  though you can sit down and eat with waiter service .   the falafel sandwich is a classic and definitely worth trying out .   you could also never go wrong with an order of hummus and pita .   it ' s not the best falafel i ' ve ever had  ( see the stand in the west-side market )  ,  but it ' s pretty darn close .   i think if they ' d find a way to make the falafel a bit more moist with a tad more spice ,  it would be just about perfect .   definitely recommend it though .   tip: for parking ,  there is a lot across the street on the east-side of the restaurant that is metered  ( 25 cents for every 15 minutes )  . 
__label__5 i tried several things from the menu and each were excellent .   it is quick ,  cheap ,  and really good .   it is not fancy inside at all ,  but that adds to the charm . 
__label__1 i came here after a long day at uh .  .  my day just got longer and longer sitting here .   the service was so slow ,  rude ,  and just generally awful .  they got both orders wrong .  .  and then half way through our food we saw two rat traps cleverly hidden behind a cardboard scrap .  holy crap ew !  !  !  !  rats ?  !  i ' m out . 
__label__5 wonderful service and excellent food !  my husband is part syrian ,  and this food was totally authentic and made with care by a husband and wife team .  we ' re visiting from san francisco and our two daughters loved everything .  definitely can recommend the hummus ,  kibbeh ,  falafel and spinach feta pie ! 
__label__2 falafel has been good in the past ,  but we went here for lunch today and really did not have the best experience .   they ' ve expanded their dining room and have more room for customers now ,  but they clearly need to learn more about customer service .     the waitress was extremely rude to us and offered no apology about the fact that it took her 30 minutes before she took our order ,  and it was another hour before we got our food .   an hour and a half was more than enough time to go to any of the other restaurants nearby ,  which is what i ' ll do for lunch next time !   really ,  their food is fine ,  but i saw many other frustrated customers waiting as well . 
__label__2 i grabbed some takeout from falafel cafe after a visit to moca and was hoping that it would be the kind of place i would be going back to .   located at the corner of euclid and mayfield roads ,  fc has been there a while as the area has picked up and grown .   one half of fc is a counter with the kitchen behind ,  the other is a dining room which struck me as a bit run down .   i ended up ordering a falafel and a spinach and mushroom pie to take home .   the falafel was a good sized rolled pita ,  with nice vegies ,  pickles and tahini; unfortunately the pita did not hold up to the 10 minute ride home and was falling apart by the time i ate it .   the falafel balls were nicely cooked ,  but a bit bland; a bit of garlic or herbs would have improved the overall sandwich .   the spinach pie was large ,  but i couldn ' t really taste the mushrooms that were suppose to be in there .   the dough was decent ,  but the filling left a bit to be desired .    overall the portions are good ,  but i found that the flavors were a bit too bland .   while conveniently located i doubt i will be heading back ,  since there are better options available . 
__label__3 good falafel and big portions .  combo meals are a good deal .  clean and conveniently located right in the heart of university circle . 
__label__4 a solid place to go for middle eastern food ,  and great for larger groups .   service can be a little slow ,  but if you expect it it ' s not too annoying .   the falafel can be a little dry ,  but they have a nice garlic sauce and house made hot sauce  ( which is actually very spicy if you like it that way !  )  . 
__label__4 small joint in the city .  .  .  non assuming decor .  .  .  the food is another .  .  .   really good flavor .   one should definitely check this place out ! 
__label__1 i went here for several months mostly for the convenience .  the food is ok .  however ,  on several occasions i observed the owner being mean to his employees .  i finally decided that it was better not to support the business . 
__label__4 i feel this is the spot with the best hummus .  not sure why it has a 3 star rating other then the somewhat disappointing service .  .  .  . my girlfriend ordered white wine which was room temp ,  so they brought us a cup of ice .  we also waited a long while to pay as our server brought our check .  .  .  . and never came back so we walked to register .  not sure if that ' s what we were supposed to do bit it ' s what we had to do .  other then the stage service ,  the food was on point . 
__label__4 i live in the dorms next door to the cafe and ,  when in serious need of a cheap ,  filling meal ,  always make sure to stop here .  their sanwiches and wraps are always a safe bet as are their bagels .    unfortunately ,  i ' m not a huge fan of their espresso drinks .  the actual house coffee is good ,  but their lattes lacked that special something .   still ,  this is a great place to take a friend ,  eat a quick meal ,  and enjoy the relaxing environment or abuse their free wifi . 
__label__2 ordered a frozen mocha .  .  .  let ' s just say the whipped cream was the best part .  but i might just be a lil salty cause i thought the dark haired girl taking orders was gonna reach over the register and stab me in the jugular .  not sure what her problem was .  the blonde that made my drink .  .  .  that ' s it .  she just made the drink .  no words for her .  but seriously i think the brunette got into her witch costume a lil too early .  .  .  it ' s only 5:00 .  chill . 
__label__4 great coffee house near csu .  in my mind anything that is not starbucks is good .  the cafe has a laid back attitude .  food is average but reliable .  i suggest grabbing a cafe cooler to chill out with during a hot summer day . 
__label__3 eh it ' s convenient .   i usually stop here to grab a tea after i get off work and have to go to class .  there ' s nothing really that special or unique about it .   they have a pretty decent tea selection and one flavored coffee everyday .    the big chocolate chip cookies are good .   i like the spicy feta turkey wrap ,  but 3 bucks for half a wrap is pretty expensive .   if it wasn ' t so close to cleveland state ,  i ' d probably never go .   they ' ve never messed up any of my orders and the workers are all really nice . 
__label__3 going to a cafe and not reviewing the coffee seems odd--i know ,  but i really don ' t think this is the place for bean connoisseurs anyways .   here ' s my take: i have never been to this cafe ,  but i let my intern pick a place near csu campus that would be easier for him to pop into for a meeting between classes .  when he picked cafe ah-roma i made these assumptions without even looking at the yelp reviews:   1 )  it ' s a campus cafe 2 )  it will be busy 3 )  there will be lots of quick food items for lunching students on the go 4 )  and there will most likely be plenty of seating and outlets for school work 5 )  this is not a fancy cafe ,  nor will it likely boast house-roasted arabica bean pour overs or $8 fancy espresso drinks  6 )  the coffee drinks will be geared towards your average ,  young adult /  student ,  who ' s in for the caffeine ,  not the recognition of buying the most expensive ,  fancy ,  local coffee in town .   all of those things were correct .  does it make this place bad ?  not at all .  in fact ,  it seemed quite popular amongst students of all sizes ,  shapes ,  etc .  it was packed midday on a tuesday ,  but there were still places to sit and plug in .  i had a plain coffee ,  which was tasty ,  and a veggie sandwich .  they have plenty of healthy and not-so-healthy lunch items that are made to order quickly .    if you ' re looking for a sophisticated ,  brag-worthy ,  snobby coffee experience--we ' ve got plenty of local joints around cle that will tickle your fancy .  but if you ' re coming here for a place to grab a quick caffeine jolt ,  a hot sammie or healthy wrap and some space to group-study with fellow csu students ?  this is right up your alley .   p . s .  can the city of cleveland please--for the love of all things holy--get on board with csu ' s awesome parking meter system ?  !  it ' s similar to those in other big cities ,  like chicago ,  where you don ' t have to be stuck in 1932 carrying around pockets full of loose change .  you can use a credit card at the pay station when you park in their metered ,  street parking spots !  gasp ! 
__label__5 came here for dinner with a friend from work .  we both had the blackened chicken salad ,  and it was really delicious .   we also split 10 wings as an appetizer ,  and they were perfectly prepared and the sauces were delicious .  elaina ,  one of the owners ,  was the bartender and cook ,  and she was really friendly and quite delightful .  i ' ll be returning ! 
__label__1 closed after an indians game !  what is the point of having a downtown restaurant if you ' re not  going to be open after tribe games .  booooo
__label__1 saw good reviews so went before a tribe game wednesday around four pm .  terrible experience ,  walked right in and sat myself along with my girlfriend .  place was empty and didn ' t see a soul until some random guy walked in from the outside and asked us if we have been taken care of .  clearly we haven ' t but once the waiter gave us our drinks we ordered two specials that were on the sign listed outside .  even though they were on the sign they were sold out before four pm .  terrible service along with a terrible atmosphere ,  will not be back . 
__label__2 got a chicken & bacon sandwich / burger with the 21 fries .  wasn ' t that great .  average bar food and i found the fries to be dry .  didn ' t have a beer ,  so maybe that would have made it better .  staff was very friendly . 
__label__5 nexus is truly the best thing to recently have opened in the downtown / east 4th area .  as a local clevelander for the past few years ,  we have needed a spot where people can gather to spend time with friends ,  read a book ,  and to also enjoy great coffee  ( sumatra )  .  their coffee and the proceeds specifically helps spread the christian word to people in another country .    as far as their food ,  it is definitely 2nd to none in the town where there are numerous great restaurants .  i ' ve personally ate crab cake sandwiches ,  veggie wraps ,  pizzas ,  and their panninis leave you wanting to come back for lunch again . 
__label__4 nexus - thank you for providing a yummy breakfast / brunch option in east 4th neighborhood .   saturdays venturing to tremont are fun ,  but it ' s nice to be able to just walk to grab food w /  friends .    as for lunch ?   everything is amazing that we ' ve sampled so far .   i recommend the vegan black bean soup .   great spice !   i picked up lunch today for a rather picky crowd ,  and everyone was very excited about their food .   the portions are large ,  ingredients are fresh ,  and the price is very reasonable for what you get .   i enjoyed that you are able to watch them create your food in the open kitchen atmosphere .   when i asked for additional this ,  or could you do that - they were incredibly responsive and friendly !    i jokingly suggested they should do delivery to 668 residents ,  and the owner said ,  "if we ' re not super busy ,  of course someone would run something up ! "  um - yes please !   how amazing - you have some house guests ,  everyone places their brunch order in ,  and 15 minutes later it ' s at your door ?   sign me up !    check it out - a nice fresh option in downtown cle ! 
__label__4 nexus ,  you ' re quite alright in my book !    cheap ,  healthy lunch options ?  i feel like that ' s almost unheard of .  thanks for making it easy to stay on track ,  body-wise and wallet-wise .  they also have some major menu perks worth mentioning .  umm ,  hello diet dr .  pepper and *gasp* pop chips !  gah--i love those damn things .  you can ' t find them many places around these parts .    the space itself looks very chill with plenty of eat-in space for business lunchers and spots to post up if you ' re using it as a mobile office .  i also love that you can see your food being freshly prepared .  the spinach flatbread was crunchy ,  melty and pretty darn healthy !    i think my only complaint  ( and it ' s minor )  is how miserable parking is over there .  it ' s a big reason why i don ' t visit e4th and the surrounding businesses during the winter months .  it ' s just too hard to find something unless you want to valet or pay and arm and a leg just to park .  *sigh* but this time of year its perfect for riding your bike over ,  skipping the traffic and parking and just enjoying a good-for-you meal .    i ' m already anticipating my return trip .  .  .  in fact ,  who ' s coming with me ?  ! 
__label__5 great dealership .   thanks ian for making the experience awesome .   everyone at the store was great and very helpful .   ian made sure that i new how everything works on the vehicle ,  and let me tell you there is a lot .   great place to buy a car .   thanks everyone . 
__label__5 thank you to chris koppi and his staff at airport mini of cleveland .   i was on a cross country trip and my 2014 jcw needed some service .   chris and his staff welcomed me with open arms .   they got my mini serviced and made sure that i was able to continue on my trip ! 
__label__5 bought a car here for my dad january of 2015 .  airport mini had the best selection of any mini dealer in the area ,  and went the extra mile to make it a very special moment for my dad .  they did some last minute mods to the car ,  like swapping for black wheels and added bonnet stripes ,  to make my dads new mini one of a kind .  when he came to pick it up ,  they had it wrapped up for him in their "delivery bay" ,  and the whole team cheered him on as they unveiled his new toy .  it ' s a memory him and i will share forever ,  and i can ' t thank the team at airport mini enough for making it such a special moment .   not sure what the other reviewer was talking about in his review  ( maybe he is too concerned with grooming his mustache )  ,  but these guys are true professionals and offered a car buying experience unlike any other .  you can trust them to find the exact mini you want and can afford .  go with airport mini ,  you won ' t be disappointed ! 
__label__5 excellent and fairly priced .  breakfast is good ,  and robin is an excellent guide for those who are unfamiliar with the area .  has a true love for cleveland and is eager to share it with those he serves .  the rooms were clean ,  comfortable ,  and he had plenty of literature and pamphlets for those who are looking to tour the area .  would definitely go back again . 
__label__5 i decided to spice up a planned weekend trip to cleveland with the girlfriend by looking for a bed & breakfast .  this was possibly the most intelligent thing i ' ve ever done ,  given the result .  the building is magnificent ,  the rooms opulent ,  the breakfast perfect and delicious .  robin is intensely passionate about old-world cleveland ,  a great storyteller ,  and equally passionate about making sure you have an agenda suited to you and the time you have to spend in cleveland .  we didn ' t get enough of this experience ,  and will return soon and often .    /  /  gracias ,  robin !   cliff y moni
__label__5 bec is amazing .  i love what she is doing with the new space . 
__label__4 their hot dogs are great .   you get a ton of fries .  i had to ask to make sure they didn ' t give me a super order or something .  and the fried bologna sandwich is good . 
__label__5 where else can you go at 8 o ' clock and get an omelette in a drive thru with a bacon wrapped ,  deep fried ,  hot dog with cheese sauce and jalapeif1os on the side ?  yeah ,  that ' s what i thought . 
__label__5 i am hooked on their calzones !  the people are so friendly and helpful with the orders .    definitely the best pizzas ! 
__label__4 the pizza here is amazing .   after being disappointed by overhyped places in little italy ,  i was very happy to finally find a go-to pizza place in cleveland .   the crust here is pretty good; it ' s not too crispy thin or excessively doughy thick .   there are plenty of toppings for building your own custom pizza and they ' ll accommodate plenty of picky eaters .   in addition to the wide array of toppings ,  dewey ' s offers a bunch of fantastic combinations that mix and match different flavors and textures .   i had the billy goat  ( no green peppers though )  and was sold on the combination of sun-dried tomatoes ,  goat cheese ,  and fresh tomatoes .   the caprice offered a classic ,  fresh margherita pizza while socrates revenge was great vegetarian blend of spinach ,  olives ,  and onions .   ryan ' s inferno was unique buffalo chicken pizza ,  which was a welcome change from the bbq chicken pizza  ( which is also available )  .   in addition to good food ,  dewey ' s has a delicious beer selection for mixing and matching drinks with your pie .   service is fantastic and food comes out as quickly as pizza can realistically bake -- so remember to be patient; the wait is well worth the gluttony .   i fully plan on coming back to dewey ' s and would highly recommend it to my friends . 
__label__4 one of the best pizza places in town .  kids will love standing by the kitchen window ,  where the pizza makers fling flour at the glass and make funny faces .  the pizza selection is excellent and creative ,  and the salads are great .  the pizzas have a thin crust that is always baked to perfection-- light and airy crust and never burned on the bottom .  one minor quibble is that i like my ingredients baked under the cheese ,  but dewey ' s opts to put them on top .  the beer selection is decent ,  and they scored major points when they had abita amber on draft leading up to mardi gras ! 
__label__4 this is a great upscale pizza place near cedar lee .   i can ' t tell you how many times i have been here .   it is the local equivalent of california pizza kitchen ,  though i would say it is a bit nicer overall . 
__label__4 cute little local spot .  great prices and decent food .  my husband and i loved going there for late night snacks when we were dating ! 
__label__4 best contemporary latin food in cleveland !  the house margeritas is awesome ,  cucumber with some heat on the edges .  the chile relleno is delicious ,  the sauce is perfect .  .  . get 2 !  !  !   the guacamole is all kinds of awesome .  i love the blue cheese version .  we have tried several times to replicate but as much as i hate to admit it ,  they make it better than i do .   why only 4 stars ?  because i can not stand that i had to wait 45 minutes one time for my reservation one time with not even a sorry or complimentary drink .  the next time i was stuck in traffic and 20 minutes late and they cancelled my reservation .  end result ?  i rarely feel inclined to drive there and take the risk of long lines .  .  .   that said ,  the food is good .  if you live on the west side live it up .  .  . 
__label__5 a birthday celebration prompted a visit to this famous cleveland mod-mex establishment .  from the drinks to the apps ,  to the entrees ,  everything was on point !  my group and i split 2 margarita samplers and guacomole appetizer  ( goat cheese ,  pecorino ,  and pineapple )  .  for the entree ,  i went with the chile relleno ,  which is an entree i use as a bench mark for all mexican restaurants in the area .    the drinks were some of the best i  ( and the group )  have ever had; the guac appetizer was fresh ,  perfectly seasoned and was gone in about 10 minutes .  the chile relleno was perfectly portioned and was not too oily ,  a common problem this dish suffers from at many mexican restaurants .  the service was phenomenal ,  with our server damian entertaining us with his humorous personality and addressing any requests we had .  his complete understanding of the menu and all the flavor profiles from the drinks to the entrees ,  was a welcome addition to the phenomenal food !  the overall atmosphere and great service made the entire experience worthwhile .    i have absolutely no quips about this restaurant .  parking is easy to find in the surrounding streets .  do yourself a favor and make a reservation though = )  good eating ! 
__label__5 if a friend from out-of-town comes to cleveland for one dinner ,  momocho is where i ' m taking them .   it ' s all been said before ,  so i ' ll say it again .   go-to items: - cucumber margarita  ( chili lime salt takes it over the top )  - trout / bacon / poblano guacamole - the machaca taquito  ( coffee & ancho braised beef brisket )  - might be my favorite dish in cleveland .   line up your beverage ,  a bowl of guacamole ,  1 . 5 kinds of taquitos per person and you ' ll be doing fine with just enough room for a side & dessert . 
__label__5 anyone who doesn ' t give this 5 stars is a hooligan .  definitely in the top 20% of restaurants i ' ve been to .  get the spicy mango margarita - it ' s to die for  ( not literally )  .  while you ' re at it ,  get the margarita sampler and snag a blood orange and hibiscus .    when you get the meals ,  they are pretty big .  could be big enough for two if you aren ' t going to eat like a cow .    bartenders are terrific .  keep doing your thang ladies and gents . 
__label__5 started a new job in slavic village ,  pass this place on my way every day .   today i decided to stop in and wasn ' t disappointed .  they place smelled great and they greeted me kindly .  i got a dozen mixed doughnuts for about 8 bucks .   they only take cash  ( which i don ' t blame them for and won ' t reduce stars for )  so i had to run down to the atm at the corner .   when i got back she seemed surprised and grateful that i actually came back .  who wouldn ' t go back for donuts ?  especially ones this delicious !   will definitely be stopping again .   doughnut love ! 
__label__4 despite the closings of numerous bakeries in slavic village  ( including the notable gertrude ' s )  ,  becker ' s remains and it ' s still a great place to get a donut .    my grandpa occasionally used to treat me and my sisters growing up to these .    75 cents for a single donut .    my cream filled maple glaze donut was fine ,  filled with quite a bit of that great sugary cream ,  all for 75 cents .  service was fine .    don ' t expect any frills .  there ' s a dozen or 2 types of donuts and black coffee ,  not  ' gourmet '  ,  that ' s about it .    yes ,  it ' s in a sketchy neighborhood and there ' s numerous signs warning of video surveillance .  becker ' s was buzzing with many service workers stopping in at 8am on a weekday .  note ,  there ' s no place to sit down here .     if you ' re looking for a no frills donut place where little has changed in 20 years ,  becker ' s is a good choice . 
__label__5 i may not be the greatest example of a gym-goer ,  considering my addiction to cup cakes and ability to procrastinate things that need done .  . such as going to the gym .   but over the past several years i tried a few different gyms ,  and before moving away i was a member of this gym for two years .   and when i moved back ,  i jumped back on the bandwagon again .     this gym is really nice .   it ' s not a huge conglomerate chain ,  and it ' s not intimidating .   being downtown ,  you get a majority of professionals squeezing in a workout between meetings or after work .   the gym itself offers a lot .   there ' s a pool ,  two different rooms with cardio machines ,  free weights ,  a hot tub ,  lots of complimentary classes ,  showers that aren ' t disgusting ,  and an outdoor rooftop track and basketball courts .   you can meet with someone at the gym to do a fitness assessment for free so you can plan your workouts ,  and also pay extra for personal training or even massages .   they offer a lot .    in march i saw a flyer that they ' re going to be offering a water yoga class in the pool .   sounds interesting .     anyways ,   i really like this gym .   and it takes a lot for me to say that ,  since i usually hate gyms . 
__label__4 my fiance and i have ben waiting since spring 2012 for this place to open .  and finally around late november we finally checked it out  ( becuase finally it was open past the summer 2012 date )  .    when we walked in ,  the resturant seemed virtually empty .  we actually almost thought it was closed .  then someone quickly spotted us and seated us close to the bar area ,  which is in the back left side of the resturant .  we were then greeted by a server who gave us the daily special and the happy hour special .   first thing that made me a fan was the $1 . 25 killian ' s .  honestly the cheapest price i have ever had for a beer i greatly enjoy .  so they got me with the price and the beer quality served .  then ,  my fiance and i ordered some onion rings ,  and as requested they got it out to us before our meal .  the server assisted us with what to order ,  and we got our drinks in a timely fashion .   when our food arrived the burgers were sereved with a garlic bread and i believe sides were ordered seprately .  i had a jalepeno stuffed burger which was not disappointing and filling .  honestly ,  i just wanted someting to eat while i was drinking cheap killians .  the serever provided checked up on us regularly ,  and ensured that the food quailty was good .    in conclusion ,  i think this place is great if you are  going for happy hour .  the drinks are cheap ,  and the service is pretty good .  it seems sparse ,  but you dont like crowded ,  loud ,  areas to eat and drink  ( and drink on the cheap )  its a good place for you .  however ,  the cons are the burgers are a bit pricey ,  but the concept of the different burgers are interesting .  so i guess its worth the price  ( i havent had anything else like it )  ,  but honestly it should be closer to $6 becuase no sides are served with the burger .    i would visit this resturant again ,  espcially for happy hour . 
__label__2 blegh .  this place was not impressive at all .  located in the old mcnulty ' s space ,  it ' s almost like being in a drunken ,  filthy ,  and questionable ghost town .  i can still hear the bass beats pummeling my eardrums and see the frat boys hitting on girls in tissues-for-dresses ,  and said girls spilling their cranberry-vodkas all over each others plasticky stilettos .    when we got here ,  i was unsure of what to expect ,  but was also not surprised when we saw a big cavernous area with large windows ,  high ceilings and not enough of anything to fill it all up .  we were also 5 of maybe 10 people in the joint ,  which made it even stranger .  our server was nice and attentive ,  but i think he was disappointed when we only wanted food and water .  we clearly weren ' t sticking around for the evening .    the food itself was sub par .  i was craving a burger  ( ie some juicy pink meat )  and i ordered the deli burger for extra meaty deliciousness .  i was sad to find that my burger was very overdone and didn ' t taste like much of anything .  there were no seasonings ,  which could have helped since the meat was flavorless and overcooked .  it was like eating a pan of completely browned ground beef and nothing else .  the toppings themselves were better and i ended up eating them after i couldn ' t bear any more of the burger .  cheese and salami .  i should have just ordered cheese and salami on that indulgent garlic bread ,  because there was nothing wrong with those !   ( i think garlic bread may not be the best choice for some burgers and i ' m surprised it ' s not just a select option for some of them .  .  .  )   my fiance got some wings and that mistake followed him the rest of the night .    it was nice to have a pickle on the side . 
__label__1 owner was very rude and condescending .  in other words a total jerk .  will not be back even though sandwich wasn ' t too bad .  such a shame . 
__label__5 just simple  .  .  . good .  .  .  . food .  .  . : )  just had the firebird chicken sandwich .  .  .  .  . pretty good .  .  . starting a pork and beef free lifestyle
__label__5 ice cream is now a science experiment .  that alone would peg this place to a few month life span .  the key is that this was very good ice cream .  clearly it could not be fresher .  the staff was accommodating and ready to answer lots of questions while they worked .  while my wife felt the price was high  ( about 20% higher than most premium parlors )  i think it was worth the price bump . 
__label__4 innovative !   they freeze the ice cream right in front of you with liquid nitrogen !   small with 2 scoops is 4 . 75 and 3 scoops 5 . 25 .   add ins are 50 cents each .   the salted caramel was delicious .   very smooth ice cream .   i prefer jenis brown butter almond brittle but i ' d say this is as great as mitchells but a little pricier but more upscale ingredients . 
__label__3 it was fun watching the ice cream made using liquid nitrogen .  however ,  the flavor i got ,  "oliver" which was described as a mixture of goat cheese ,  figs ,  and honey was very disappointing .  i love figs and goat cheese and honey and was told that you can taste the figs and see the seeds .  i neither saw the seeds nor tasted a hint of the figs which they described as strong .  it tasted more like salted caramel and i thought maybe they gave me the wrong one .  when i asked about it ,  they looked at the container which had very little if the mixture left and the seeds were still on the bottom of it .  they hadn ' t bothered to stir it when they made mine !  i wasn ' t offered a refund nor did they ask if they could make another one .   .  instead i received what i perceived to be an insincere apology .  i walked out very disappointed ,   especially considering the high price of it .  my husband and i drove here from cincinnati last night but there ' s nothing to brag about the ice cream place .  the only reason why i ' m not giving it a lower rating is that we also got the silk chocolate was much better tasting . 
__label__5 i ' ll be honest ,  i ' m writing this review about a week after i went there .  as i ' m sitting here in my kitchen my wife reminds me for the 87th time this week that she is seriously craving more piccadilly ice cream i feel compelled to write down our small families thoughts and opinions .   my wife and i have traveled the world ( slightly )  and we actually tried gelato in italy and the famous turkish ice cream in turkey and honestly we loved all of it .  in italy especially ,  we thought nothing would compare to some fresh gelato .   well .  .  .  one day we went to piccadilly and everything we knew ,  everything we believed in was turned to nothing .  a bunch of nothingness .   they freeze it before your very eyes !  !  !  !  !  !  seriously .  it can ' t get any more fresh !  instantaneous ice cream with no ice crystals .  it is just the creamiest smoothest ice cream of your life .  .  .  of my life .  .  .  of my wife ' s life !  creamiest ice cream of all our lives combined !  !  !  !  !   if you ' ve never had liquid nitrogen frozen ice cream i strongly urge you .  .  .  nay .  .  earnestly beg you ,  don ' t live your life this way anymore .  go get some .  change your life .  you ' ll never regret it .   unless you ' re lactose intolerant .  then don ' t ,  and i ' m sorry you had to read all this .  . 
__label__5 best ice cream i have ever had hands down .  it ' s not cheap ,  but it ' s worth every penny .  there are a lot of custom options if you are the kind of person who knows exactly how you want your ice cream ,  but also some tasty creative combos to choose from .  i would highly recommend the "shelby . "   great customer service .  the ambiance is urban chic and classy .  you won ' t regret coming here !  ! 
__label__5 the best liquid nitrogen ice cream in cleveland ,  period !  creative flavors ,  fresh toppings ,  fun to watch them make your ice cream fresh right in front of you ,  with all that "smoke" coming from the bowl .  adrian ,  the owner ,  even made it fun for the kids by doing a little demo with liquid nitrogen - pouring it on the floor ,  the counter ,  and even putting a drop on their hands .  the ice cream starts out as a liquid which they pour into a mixer .  then they add the liquid nitrogen in while its mixing .  the ice cream comes out super smooth and creamy !  my personal favorites - taro and salted caramel . 
__label__5 i ' ve walked past this place couple times ,  it sees really nice and smells delicious .  next time i ' ll be in cleveland i ' m definitely going to try it !  the place es very romantico  . 
__label__5 headquarters facilities of case western ' s university hospital system .   hard to review the entire structure and services in one review as each department has its own personality down to the professionalism and bedside manner of each caregiver and administrator .   in general ,  i feel this is a world-class facility in terms of medicine specialties present ,  the wide variety of complex medical services rendered ,  layout and functionality of the buildings  ( despite the many years of continued expansion and merging )  ,  and the general perception of cleanliness and equipment health .   i ' ve had wonderful customer service from caregivers in many departments .   i ' ve also had the occasional substandard customer service from a doctor and nurse - but this is not the norm in my experience .   unfortunately ,  if there ' s any attitude or disservice to be expected ,   it ' s usually from the non-caregivers such as the cashier / parking office and financial / administrative personnel .    while i ' m actually a cleveland clinic patient now  ( long story due to an uh oncologist who i felt was unprofessional )  ,  i continue to volunteer my time at one of the departments here . 
__label__5 i came here for a cardiac ablation surgery in which they ran electrodes up my femoral vein into my heart where they burned / destroyed some nerves that were firing aberrantly .    everyone on my surgical team  ( except one nurse whom i will describe next )  was absolutely incredible and professional .  the team was led by dr .  mauricio arruda who is a well-known electrophysiologist with several protocols named after him and a special cardiac ablation procedure that he developed .   because of the nature of my surgery i had to be kept completely conscious .  this can be very scary and nerve wrecking ,  especially for me ,  as i pass out very easily .  the nurses  ( except the one mentioned above )  were unbelievably nurturing and attentive .  one nurse stood by my side and held great ,  distracting conversation with me for 80% of the time only leaving to do things he had to do for the surgery .  the fellow on my team ,  also an excellent physician ,  explained the entire procedure in great detail and described potential outcomes that may be encountered through the process .    the surgery was a 100% success .  my heart no longer has 40 , 000 irregular beats a day .  every time i check my pulse it ' s normal .  i am so grateful and no longer live in fear that something might happen .    now: for the unbelievably unprofessional nurse that was on my team .  i am going to list out the four major instances that i found to be disturbing .  number three is by far the most absurd thing of all .    1 )  upon meeting this nurse ,  another nurse on my team immediately showed discomfort by his presence .  he began making lots of weird jokes about not doing things the correct way  ( which normally i would brush off .  but what followed is why i am mentioning this behavior )   2 )  the fellow  ( physician post-residency )  who would be performing part of the surgery is middle eastern .  as he was explaining the procedure ,  this rude nurse came up and says "yes he is a super perfectionist .  he constantly yells at me when i mess up" and the fellow smiled politely .  then the nurse had the audacity to say "honestly ,  the only english word this man knows is a cuss word . " i could not believe my ears .    3 )  at the start of my surgery the fellow began to inject my groin  ( area between the crotch and thigh )  with a numbing agent .  this unprofessional nurse comes in with a giant plastic pole looking thing and jokingly shoves the fellow on the back with it !  can you believe that ?  !  the fellow literally had a needle in my groin and this nurse shoves him !  the fellow turned around to indicate that he was actively performing my surgery .  unbelievable .  ********  4 )  the kind nurse who spoke with me during the surgery was asking me what i do .  i am a neuroscience phd candidate at kent state .  i also have a masters and a couple of bachelor degrees .  this unprofessional nurse interrupts our convo and goes "where do you go to school ? " and when i told him kent state he replies "can ' t read ,  can ' t write ,  kent state ! " look ,  i can take a joke .  had this kind nurse said this to me i would have laughed because he had shown his decent character clearly .  but this man ,  i just could not believe the back-to-back inappropriateness that was going on .    i do plan to contact the hospital about this particular nurse ,  while making it clear that everyone else was absolutely wonderful .  including the check-in and administrative people . 
__label__1 charged twice for one visit .  no matter who you contacted ,  they could not explain the double charge or reserve ,  they said they would look into it ,  but nothing was done .  they just kept threatening collections .  so my we paid it .  if you live in cleveland ohio ,  just shut up and accept inferior health care you have to pay for twice .  we moved here from california to save money on housing ,  but did not realize we would spend that savings on the corrupt and incompetent medical systems .  visits that cost 15 dollars in california cost 150 in ohio . 
__label__5 i am not from the cleveland area but chose seidman cancer center as my first choice to be treated for breast cancer .  i was so pleased with my care and treatment that if i could give it 10 stars i would .  i cannot say enough about not only the care but the genuine compassion this cancer center gives to the patient .  the 80 mile trip each was was well worth every minute . 
__label__1 don ' t trust their security .  they don ' t care if the male patrons of the bar assault women .  it ' s "not their problem" .   .   . not my scene anyways . 
__label__2 i can ' t comment on anything other than the atmosphere .  with that said ,  i ' m probably being generous by giving this place 2 stars .  i will say the exterior patio is the only shining star in this eyesore .   i was meeting a friend from campus which is the sole reason i stopped at this place .  before i entered i watched a girl vomit all over her friends shoes as they were leaving  ( who replied ,  "haha ,  you puked on my shoes ! " )  and a girl who was leaning on the side of a truck fall sideways and crash into the pavement of the parking lot while making out with a guy .   i gave the place a second try a month or so later with a group of friends .  the highlight of my evening was sarcastically asking the friend of a girl i was chatting up if she had some psoriasis on her arm .  excitedly she responded that my diagnosis was correct .  yuck . 
__label__1 first i was thrown off my the mobile phone sign covering the door .   then the inside seemed over crowed with tables .   there was a little side room that had misc products form olive oil to tide .     i walked in today to order take out and was surprised at the $8 . 25 fattoush salad .   so i decided to order a spinach pie to go .   for $2 . 25 i received a dry over cooked ,  microwaved spinach pie that was tiny- like cocktail party size .   i was very disappointed and will not return .   best to stick with the aladdin ' s factory on carnegie or oasis bakery  on detroit  ( they make the fresh spinach pie while you wait ) 
__label__4 classic lebanese food that was delicious and so much better than heading to the chicago deli or some other homogenous lunch spot .   they have everything you could want and many things that are fairly mainstream .   don ' t be intimidated by the non-american fare because you will feel like you ' ve traveled somewhere once you ' ve eaten here . 
__label__2 we went for a group lunch .  the portion is kinda small compare with similar lebanese food places .  the wrap is hard to bite as it was from bagged flat bread .    btw ,  they will move to a unknown location as cleveland clinic will torn down the building . 
__label__2 decided to try this place after driving by .   checked the reviews on yelp and i decided to stop in for lunch .   the guy at the counter was very very helpful and patient as i studied their menu and asked questions .   he made suggestions and i finally decided to try the hummus shawarma combo plate .   i ' ve had a lot of lebanese food lately so i was excited to try this new spot .  i really didn ' t care for the food at all .   the presentation was nice for takeout but the humus had a sweetness to it that was unexpected and there was some sort of seasoning on the meat or something that just didn ' t agree with me .   i won ' t be going back .   primarily because it was also a very expensive lunch . 
__label__4 pizza is always yummy .   i tend to gravitate towards plain pepperoni pizzas and i wasn ' t disappointed .   i also love their cheese sticks .   they are so great .   also ,  you get a free pizza with every pizza you order .   great deal ! 
__label__5 i ' m the type of person that tries to order something new every time .   pizza bogo basically blows my mind .   i order quite a bit of catering so i ' ve tried more pizza ' s than my waistline can bear .  .  . but let me tell you - they ' re all great .   i especially like the world cuisines because they really are out of the box flavors .   i also appreciate that the manager bethany is more than helpful and is always prompt with her deliveries .   i ' ve never had a problem with timing or with orders and from the amount of times i ' ve ordered from them ,  that ' s really impressive !     basically they ' re inexpensive pizzas with elaborate and inventive toppings .   for a franchise ,  it ' s top notch !   my only complaint is i wish it had sit-down seating because i don ' t live nearby and yet still want pizza bogo ! 
__label__5 pizza bogo is a great fresh pizza kitchen in the city !  most of the ingredients are local and fresh cut daily .   the staff is very friendly and knowledgable .  they accommodate allergies and can give you detailed information on their cooking practices and kitchen .  love this place !  tuesday and wednesday are pizza discount day after 3p for as many toppings as you like ,  so go bananas !  unfortunately ,  bananas are not a topping option but banana peppers are so you ' re in luck !  enjoy to your hearts delight !  the cleveland heights location is best !  lakewood will not give you the tues&wens deal and their attitudes are a tad less friendly .  go out of your to come to the cleveland heights location !  #itsworthit
__label__1 went in to fill up with premium gas .  regular was advertised for $2 . 399 .   didn ' t notice until my car was full that they charged $4 . 239 for premium !  when i went in to complain about the pricing error ,  i was told the manager instructed the station to charge the higher price for premium .   buyers beware ! 
__label__5 my ,  my fiancie and brothers go to comic shop !  we have been going here for many years .  never had any problems .  always a fun and enjoyable experience !  love looking thru the cheap boxes and of course i am on the pull list !  always something new and fun to look at here ! 
__label__5 i can ' t say enough good things about the clp main library !     to give some context to my personal discovery of cpl main library over the last year - i ' m someone who somewhere along the way forgot that libraries exist ,  and have gotten used to ordering books  ( that i ' ll only read once  ( if that )  )  on amazon .  it just didn ' t register in my brain that there is a massive building right around the corner from me chock full of free books ,  dvds ,  and audiobooks .  i mean .  .  .   first and foremost ,  i have been able to find pretty much any item i ' ve wanted in their immense collection .  how ' s this for random: my mission was to get the new chelsea handler book ,  a new book on roller coasters ,  and sofia coppola ' s "somewhere . " got them all ,  and was in and out in about 15 minutes .    also ,  the library feels truly dedicated to promoting education and openness through community outreach .  going to the library at any given time ,  you are bound to come across some sort of free  ( quality )  event - whether it be a jazz concert ,  movie screening ,  or poetry reading .    cpl ' s integration with online resources is incredibly useful .  the detailed ,  user friendly online catalog allows you to do research at home ,  and then zip in and out of the library if you ' re in a pinch for time .    also ,  of course ,  the building itself is beautiful .    basically ,  the cpl mail library has reminded me that libraries exist in general ,  and that they are a valuable resource that helps me feel connected to the community ,  and ,  one that gets me access to free stuff : ) 
__label__5 first time i have been to cleveland .  i was wandering off and exploring when i came to the cleveland public library .  i have been to numerous libraries in new york and all of them were minuscule compared to this library .  it felt humongous and the reading room looked like a church .  would come back to read more ! 
__label__5 first off ,  this restaurant looks awesome inside !  the decor is art deco and there are real gas lights !  it has a tin ceiling and glass chandeliers .  the only thing that ruins the ambiance is the tvs - they don ' t belong in such a classy looking place .  anyway ,  about the food: i ordered the platter with gumbo ,  jambalaya ,  and ratatouille and my boyfriend got the shrimp po boy with hushpuppies .  everything tasted good ,  although the gumbo was a little bit too spicy for me .  we got creme brulee for dessert and it was pretty delicious .  as far as price goes ,  our bill was a little more than we would have liked ,  but not too expensive to prevent us from coming back  ( although next time we will order less )  .  drinks were a bit pricey in my opinion though .  definitely worth a visit . 
__label__3 the only thing i have to comment about is the poor service .  the food was great !  i got the shrimp and grits  ( amazing !  didn ' t even know i liked grits )  and my boyfriend got the gumbo which he really liked !  portions were large ,  and decently priced .  we had the pick three app ,  the hush puppies were amazing and the red beans were great .  the jambalaya was dry ,  and didn ' t taste fresh ,  but was still had potential .  the only thing that didn ' t seem to have potential was our server kelly .  we each got a flight of beers  ( four 4oz beers for $10 ,  great beer selection ,  do it !  )  and our server couldn ' t even tell us which beer was which .  when asked ,  she responded "you ' ll figure it out" .  i asked for a menu recommendation and she didn ' t have one .  when asked what a menu item was ,  she read me the description off of the menu .  no personality ,  didn ' t greet us when we sat down ,  and acted like she didn ' t care about our table at all .  as a server of 8 years ,  i am very forgiving of servers .  it ' s a tough job some times ,  but all it takes is a good attitude to get a good tip from me .  the decor ,  food ,  drinks ,  and atmosphere were great ,  i would recommend every thing other than our server ! 
__label__4 until recently ,  i had never been to the barrel room .  it was like a weird ,  dirty little secret that loomed over my head for so long .    i finally had a good reason to come when yelp elite ashley b hosted her fundraiser for laura ' s home on the second floor .  full disclosure: we were on the second floor only .  as a bar in tremont ,  i found the barrel room particularly beautiful and spacious .  a two floor ,  new orleans style bar ,  smack on professor avenue ?  yes ,  please !  as joyce h pointed out ,  the beautiful ornamental metals and lovely chandeliers make a really memorable audience .  a lot of care and attention to detail has been immersed into this place !   our servers were awesome and attentive .  i had two cocktails: the pisco sour and their signature gimlet .  i can ' t tell you how happy i was to see a pisco sour on the cocktail menu .  so often ,  i can never find this drink in bars around town .  both drinks were perfect and expertly crafted .  for dinner ,  everyone at my table had a different entree ,  and our forks were stealing bites left and right .  i took a chance on the shrimp and grits-- again ,  a hard dish to pull off ,  in my opinion -- and they were surprisingly awesome .  loved the thick ,  buttery consistency of the grits and the generous amount of baby shrimps .   can ' t wait to come back again soon during the day for an experience on the 1st floor ! 
__label__1 got seated at 3 pm on a saturday afternoon with the restaurant only half full .  sat with girlfriend at a table for 15-20 minutes without anyone waiting on us .  finally ,  a server from another area asked if we were being wait on and we said no .  she said she would take us but we figured we wouldn ' t get our food til midnight if we had stayed ,  so we walked out .  we weren ' t seated in a dark corner ,  either ,  but right square in the middle on the main aisle .  hope the food isn ' t as bad as the service . 
__label__5 overview: considering i ' ve done a lot of dining in new orleans ,   i can definitely say that the cuisine here is equivalent to ,  if not better than ,  the majority of the places i ' ve been .  the ambience makes you feel as if you ' re in a classy place in the french quarter ,  with gas lamps ,  balconies ,  and fluers de lis on the walls .  drinks: the draft beer list is extensive ,  offering unique selections .  .  .  don ' t pass up abita ' s ,  an excellent louisiana beer that comes in multiple flavors  ( pecan was my favorite )  .  and of course you should try an authentic hurricane ,  too .  food: many new orleans favorites to choose from .  hush puppies were the best i ' ve ever had .  the jambalaya was also really fantastic and the crispy poullet po '  boy was tasty .   to sum it up: attention to detail makes this place stand out .  i really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it to others ,  whether they ' ve been to new orleans before or this will be their first "trip . "
__label__5 loved the food here !  !  it was authentic and delicious !  i usually get the sampler which is worth the cost .  the service was superb also .  if you ' re looking for authentic new orleans home away from home food ,  this is the place to go ! 
__label__4 we tried bourbon for the first time last weekend for my partner ' s birthday .  tremont was happening that evening because of some kind of beer festival .  the restaurant didn ' t seem too crowded and we were seated on the patio almost immediately .  the selection of drinks was large and we both got mixed drinks which arrived quickly and were presented very well .   after we ordered food however the service became increasingly slow ,  apparently due to the amount of activity in the area .   when the food did arrive it was very good .   overall i would recommend trying bourbon but just be aware that the kitchen seems to me to get overwhelmed on a busy night . 
__label__5 excellent !   the crab cake appetizer was small but delicious; loaded with crab meat .   the salmon was cooked perfectly .   blackened and moist .   absolutely delicious .   the shrimp and grits was truly authentic and again ,  absolutely delicious .   others in our party had the burger ,  po ' boy and sirloin .   everyone fully enjoyed their meals .   they also have an extensive beer menu .   the service was great .  will definitely visit again next time i am in cleveland . 
__label__5 it was a beautiful day yesterday .  i was waking through tremont  and ran into the inviting atmosphere of the bourbon street barrel room .  me n my fiance weren ' t super hungry so we shared the hot legs  ( frog legs )  and hot rocks  ( fried shirmp )  .  both were delicious !  !  !  it was my first time trying frog legs and i ' m glad it and done there ,  they were fried to perfection and the sauce and slaw that accompanied it was the icing on the legs lol .  anywho the service was on point and the open patio in the back was beautiful .  .  .  .  can ' t wait to go try more of the menu .  oh !  and i can ' t forget about the mamosa ' s !  !  !  delicious !  !  for happy hour its 2$ off wine , beer , cocktails ,  and starters  ( appetizers s )  so we took full advantage  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 
__label__2 this k is sadly dirty especially floors  .  some one needs to teach how to mop: (  (  the plus everyone is friendly : ) 
__label__4 take this place for what it is .  .  .  the best taco joint around .  it ' s simple ,  i can ' t eat there every day but its fun and inexpensive .  just use the taco chit wisely  ( don ' t add a ton of things to your taco )  the crew who works there is great once you get to know them .  always try the specials ,  i ' ve never been dissatisfied .  barrio has a great happy hour as well ,  i must say wednesday is my favorite where whiskey ,  bourbon and scotch are all half off until 7pm !  great little place . 
__label__2 long waits .  below average tacos .  expensive margaritas .  hipsters everywhere .  dont get why its so "cool"
__label__5 probably the best margaritas in cleveland and most of if not all of them are half off during happy hour .   their tacos are huge and i love how you can create your own with the different meat ,  cheese ,  sauce ,  and shell combinations .   highly recommended !  ! 
__label__5 my girlfriend and i love barrio !  we travel from 45 minutes away to eat here pretty regularly .  barrio is great because they are accommodating to many dietary restrictions .  we like to bring our friends here so that we don ' t have to struggle to find a restaurant with good vegan and vegetarian options .    we usually have to wait a bit for a table ,  but there is lots to do in the area .  the hosts usually take your number and call when your table is ready .    for those who haven ' t been to barrio before ,  the menu is based on create your own tacos .  you are given a menu ,  and you choose what you want on the taco .  and the best part is ,  it ' s insanely cheap and good ! 
__label__5 no other words to describe barrio except freaking awesome !  my boyfriend is from cleveland so we often come up and visit family .  i think we have been to barrio on every trip since we ' ve been together .  it is a family favorite and just a great place .  relaxed environment with always friendly staff ,  great drinks ,  great special quesos ,  and the food is awesome .  you ' ll have fun creating your own masterpiece of a taco .  wish i had one where i lived but it ' s always something we look forward to on visits .  keep up the good work . 
__label__5 a great place for a good drink .   the harbor inn ,  not only has a great upstairs room to rent out for large groups ,  but the downstairs -the true heart of the harbor inn - is where the magic happens .   imagine yourself stepping into one of the oldest bars in cleveland and hearing a mix of classic polka tunes and "i ' m on a boat" .   yep ,  there you go !     i also suggest doing the "dusty bottle tour" .   they have lots to choose from ,  many of which will burn going down and you can absolutely get your $3 worth . 
__label__4 ordered the bacon cheddar bbq burger through grubhub .  came out fast and the woman working there when i picked it up was extremely nice .  the burger itself was amazing and i had the 21 fries which were good as well . 
__label__3 went here before a tribe game .   the interior is a little weird .   the cinder block walls aren ' t too inviting .    food sounds better than it tastes .  .  . 3 stars .    nothing special .    service was really good .  .  .  she was on the ball and attentive .   drink specials during games . 
__label__5 this may be the best mexican restaurant in ohio .   warning: it is definitely not your typical tex-mex cuisine -- it is much ,  much better !   because of this ,  it is very popular ,  so you may need to make reservations ahead of time .   my wife and i have eaten here twice without reservations ,  and the only space available was at the bar .   that ' s ok with us ,  as it was just the two of us .   plus ,  the bartender was willing to give us a quick course on tequilas and some of the delicious cocktails that can be made with it .   most recently ,  along with our margaritas ,  we enjoyed shared orders of goat cheese guacamole with tortilla chips ,  shrimp taquitos ,  and smoked gouda tamales .   all of it delicious !   their parking lot is small ,  and was full ,  but we were able to find a space on the street a half-block away . 
__label__4 i literally got into an uber and told the driver to take me to a kick-ass place for dinner .  he suggested momocho ' s and touted their impressive mexi-fare menu .  the food -- impressive .  eight wildly different kinds of guacamole from which to choose  .  .  .  plus ,  an inspired menu of both tex and mex .  the venue -- darkened .  it was like dining in a delightfully decorated underground lair .  the service -- haphazard .  when i sat down two people jumped to take my order ,  but as it turned out neither was my server .  that honor went to the bartender -- uh ,  because i sat at the bar .  he seemed a bit frazzled / discombobulated while i was there .  shame  .  .  .  because the rest of the staff was hyper-friendly -- including an oh-so chatty bus boy who was admittedly hopped up on caffeine .  i was in and out in twenty minutes -- even though my entree came out before my appetizer .   ( the flummoxed bartender took it off my bill .  props .  )  be sure to rock the guac while you ' re there -- it ' s a highlight .  the drink menu and dessert menu looked fun too . 
__label__4 summary:  delicious tacos with good happy hour specials -- just don ' t stay too long .  .  .   full story:  tried this place with a friend for post-work friday happy hour .   everything we tried was really tasty  ( and all new to me !  )  .    it was busy ,  but not too packed around 6 .   the taquitos are served like fajitas .  .  .  a hot bowl with a base of peppers and onions with the other ingredients on top .  .  .  and then some small corn tortillas .  loved the beet and spinach tacos with baked goat cheese and peppers .  .  .  .  very satisfying .   really liked the ground pepita dip and the habeif1ero sauce with it !    ( if you ' re a cilantro-hater ,  the dip has some in it but baaarely noticeable )  .     the hh menu is great  ( all the tacos ,  a couple marg options ,  + sangria )  ,  and they have hh at 5 - 6:30pm every weekday .   that said ,  i ' d consider the regular-hours menu a little over-priced .    *** our waiter was super friendly and great .   the only sour spot came a little after 7 ,  when a hostess came up  ( without introducing herself )  to say they had a reservation for our table at 7  ( i . e .  ,  basically telling us to leave before the ink was dry on our bill .  .  .  .  )  .    what ' s up with that !  ?   it ' s a smaller restaurant ,  but seems weird to have a reservation for a downstairs table within 30 min of 6:30 .  .  .  when people are likely to be there for hh .    also wasn ' t sure why this anti-hospitality approach was taken instead of something like "could we offer you a drink and seat you at the bar to accommodate a larger group ? "   meh .     note: small parking lot to the l of the restaurant if you ' re facing it !   also some street spots . 
__label__3 went here on a saturday night  !  it was pretty packed but got seated right away !  the atmosphere was very dim and the seating area was very small !  we looked over the menu and ordered the flights of margaritas  and their well known guacamole on tv !  we ordered the pickled corn / crab / chile chipotle guacamole  !  the guac came out with chips .  the chips was really delicious and the guac stood out  !  for our main entree we got the pork tacos and the beef pastrami tacos !  all the tacos came with tortillas separately and the dish itself with different assorted condiments .  in my opinion the pork tacos was okay !  and the beef pastrami was not my favorite !  the meat was in form of pastrami but the taste of it was very bland and plain !  overall the atmosphere was okay little dim for me !  the service was good !  the guacamole was very delicious but the tacos lacked a lot of flavor to me  ! 
__label__5 their margarita sampler is amazing ,  i had it x2 !  their chips are so fricking delicious ,  they are the perfect crispy salty goodness that you won ' t find at the likes of chipotle .  we had their guacamole which was also soooo good .  i am so happy we checked this place out and will totally make an effort to make it here again if we ' re in the area . 
__label__4 arrived a little after five pm and we were seated promptly .  the tables began to fill up very fast ,  so you should definitely have a res .  happy hour is wonderful here .  $4 gold margaritas plus half off taquitos !  !  to start off with ,  we had the salsa trio .  i liked two of the three .  the verde lacked some flavor ,  but the pico and pineapple & jicama were spot on .  chips were a bit salty .  for the taquitos ,  i had the machacha ,  beef braised with ancho and coffee .  delicious !  my other half had the wild boar which was pretty good as well .  and of course we had to get dessert .  the fried ice cream was huge but oh so good !  the service was excellent .  tom was our server and spot on about everything ! 
__label__5 never thought i would find such a gem in cleveland ohio .  starting with the guac trio and margaritas to the pork chicken and shrimp entrees our table enjoyed .  they house make the hot sauce with a carrot base which is highly recommended ! 
__label__2 i ordered a trio of margaritas ,  which was a fun little tasting ,  and i would highly recommend the guava and the chilli mango if you like a little spiciness in your alcohol ,  but would skip the blood orange .   i happened to be sitting at the bar ,  though ,  and the margarita magic was diminished when i saw them pouring the margaritas out of what resembled industrial-sized vinegar jugs straight into glasses .  at least if i was seated at a table ,  then i would be blissfully ignorant and believe that my  ( overpriced )  margarita was individually hand crafted .  lol -- they should transfer them to more attractive pitchers ,  etc .  if they ' re going to serve it in front of customers to at least trick us .   the tortillas were on point ,  but we did have to wait a long time for more tortillas; i think i ordered the carnitas ,  which was very tender ,  but way too sour for me .     oh yeah -- the guacamole: on the recommendation of our server / bartender ,  we settled on the crab guacamole ,  and it was terrible .   the crab was very fishy and didn ' t taste fresh -- i know i ' m in the midwest ,  but this was truly not good .   we managed to exchange it for the pineapple guac which had a nice sweetness to it ,  so it was initially all good .   unfortunately ,  our bartender / server shafted us by charging us for both guacs ,  and then gave me attitude when i asked to have one of the guacamoles removed from the bill .   anyway ,  i won that battle ,  but it left a bad taste in my mouth  ( no pun intended )  and have zero plans to return . 
__label__4 an oasis in the midst of calamitous noise .   an easy trail providing an ideal place to get your steps in for the day .   after a little while on the trail i forgot that i had just came from a busy ,  noisy place ,  and was aware of only the serenity i was experiencing .   the beautiful sounds of the birds ,  which are in abundance ,  and the calming ,  rhythmic sounds of the lake settled my heart and lifted my spirit .   the trail provides ample shade when the sun is out and hot and benches for resting and taking in the melodic sounds .   i really enjoyed sitting on the benches at the overlook taking in the cityscape and watching the boats on the water . 
__label__1 horrible experience .  toilet nasty !  towels and sheet stained .  key did not work three times in a row after going to office each time .  then happened again the second night .  dirty grounds .  shady people hanging out .  maid came took dirty towel and didn ' t replace .  didn ' t clean at all . 
__label__5 went here on the recommendation of a friend on a sunday morning .  we were only the people in there ,  received great ,  very personable service ,  and good food cooked basically right in front of us .  oh ,  and it ' s real cheap .  i think my whole meal was like $6 .  this is a great hole in the wall diner .    it is open 24 hours which is a definite plus if i ever come back to cleveland . 
__label__5 it ' s one of the most affordable diners i ' ve come across in cleveland and everyone is always very welcoming and nice .  it ' s been around for ages ,  so i ' m told ,  and the building is a bit small ,  but that just adds to the cozy feeling .  if you want a stupid cheap burger  (  $3 )  or hot dog  ( $1 . 50 )  or a breakfast made to perfection ya gotta try this tiny little gem out . 
__label__5 oh .  my .  god .    handmade chocolates .  hand .  made .  chocolates !  !   i just ate a large bag full of handmade chocolates .   you don ' t get to judge me unless you been here .  if you ' ve been here and eaten her chocolates ,  then you can judge me .  but until then .  .  .  you don ' t know me .   hand .  made .  chocolates .   handmade chocolates . 
__label__5 we highly recommend timan windows .  they are ultimate professionals who know their business as well as listen to their customers to help them make their home look beautiful . 
__label__1 food is okay .  i had the pasta dish with chicken and thought it was average .  the main reason for my discontent is the rude customer service .  our group was asked to leave after about 1 . 5hrs even though we had already paid our bill and wrapping up our conversation anyways .  i have never experienced this at any restaurant before and i ' m very well travelled  ( dubai ,  nyc ,  paris ,  toronto just to name a few )  .  worst case scenario restaurants ask u multiple times if you want anything else after sitting around for 3+ hrs .  my first and last time at gwt .  very awful feeling ! 
__label__3 the food here is good .  very good .  i had been ogling the menu online for a couple days before we finally went and still had trouble picking because every description sounded amazing .  i settled on the zinfandel short ribs and they did not disappoint-  so soft and packed with flavor .   my bf got the blackened scallops and they were done really well too- as were his cheesy chorizo filled mashed potatoes that i swooped in on .   our tuna bites appetizer was a bit underwhelming  ( 3 small slices of mediocre tuna for $13 .  .  meh )  ,  but the tiramisu for dessert was great .  wine selection is great too and complemented our meal perfectly .   so why the 3 stars ?  ?   when we got in ,  we stood at the hostess '  table waiting for someone to take our names ,  tell us table availability ,  etc .   the bartender ,  cooks ,  and waitresses  ( 3 of them )  all were right there a foot or two away from us ,  looked at us ,  tried not to make eye contact ,  and shuffled away .  not one person managed to acknowledge our existence .  for 15 minutes .  after we asked to be helped 3 times .  we were about to walk out when finally one of the waiters came by and mentioned they were really busy and he ' d be with us soon .  they made up for this with good service the rest of the time but this put a terrible start on the night .   besides ,  the dining room had about 5 tables seated ,  and 3 waiters working- they should be able to handle that pretty easily .  we didn ' t need to be seated right away ,  but at the very least they should know to ask if customers have been helped ,  mention they ' re shortstaffed but will be there in a minute to take down a name ,  etc .  anything !  don ' t look at us and scuffle away .  poor form . 
__label__3 table and bar service excellent .  food tasted good ,  but for a brunch ,  portions were disappointingly small .  it wasn ' t that we came late in the day either ,  where they might have run out of their brunch options . 
__label__3 went here on a double date .   the group was seated promptly at this no-frills tavern .   i wouldn ' t quite call it a wine bar .  .  .  but they do have a respectable list of options for drinks .   the bf and i ordered the short rib - which i would rate a 4 on food alone ,  and the bison pot roast - which unfortunately earns a 2 . 5 on food alone .   maybe i had my expectations set to high based on reviews ,  but nobody in the party was overly happy with the food .   i would say the short rib was by far the favorite .   i think it ' s a possible option for some decent food in a casual atmosphere if you ' re near by .   but for us ,  it was a bit of a drive and an effort that unfortunately is unlikely to be repeated .   ----------------------------------- explanation of my rating system - 5*: epitome of something ,  the best i ' ve had ,  would love to go back 4*: great food and happy to go back regularly ,  but not the best of the category 3*: food is fine .   i may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience .   but no need to go back either .  2*: if you insist ,  i guess i ' ll come along .  i ' ll find something to eat .  but i wouldn ' t have picked it .  1*: no plans to come back .   i ' ll try to talk companions out of going . 
__label__4 this unassuming west park joint is cranking out some seriously good food .  my husband and i were having one of those bumming-around saturday afternoons and stopped in for a beer and some munchies .  my house-made potato chips arrived warm and with a good amount of rosemary ,  and my single slider was perfectly browned and swaddled in a toasty bun .  the husband chose a daily special ,  a blt with fried shrimp in a tasty slaw ,  which blew us both away .  as for beer selection ,  only two were on tap- great lakes christmas ale and gl ' s edmund fitzgerald .  i ' m a huge fan of the edmund ,  so had to go with that .  they did have a nice bottled selection ,  including left hand milk stout and bell ' s two hearted ale .  our bartender was friendly and knowledgeable ,  and made our lovely lazy afternoon at the lion even more memorable . 
__label__4 damn hell ass ,  what a great place .  a really low-key ,  cool-looking old bar that also happens to serve fantastic grub .  went here on st .  patrick ' s day expecting to be knee-deep in green vomit ,  but everybody here was very cool .  no pinches or punches to the face that i can remember .  myself and my compatriots all got the special ,  which was a solid reuben with a side of something called a "noodleboat . " the reuben itself was delicious .  a nice touch was the fried  ( as in fried on the grill )  corned beef .  that was definitely a nice surprise .  the noodleboat was a side serving of egg noodles  ( duh )  with chopped corned beef ,  sauerkraut ,  potatoes ,  carrots ,  and some other greens .  i would come back here just for that .  service was friendly ,  bar ambiance was great ,  and i will certainly be back . 
__label__2 i saw the positive reviews on yelp and decided to give them a shot .   i honestly cannot see what is so great about this place .  i think most of the reviews end up positive because of the cheap priced beer .  being cheap doesn ' t make it good and my visit was not pleasant .   i immediately felt out of place as i walked in the door .  this is a local dive / biker bar .  if you have a shirt that requires buttoning ,  this is not your place .   the tables are too tall for the barstools .  it was very uncomfortable to sit and eat a meal .  it felt like i was a little kid at the adult table .   the food itself was a disappointment .  i ordered a couple tacos and a friend ordered a burger .  the meat for the tacos are something that i would liken to dog food .  burned and chopped up into tiny pebbles .  very unappealing .  overall ,  combination of items and textures on the tacos did not equal a tasty package .  throwing a piece of salami on a taco doesn ' t make it special .   my friend ordered a medium well burger .  it came out completely charred .  one small bite and it tasted like charcoal .  the server asked if we wanted them to remake it .  i declined ,  because i didn ' t want to spend another 25 minutes waiting for them to put out another burger .  she then commented that next time we should order it medium .    she took the burger away and still charged us for it on the bill .  it was inedible .  thanks ,  for the lame experience . 
__label__5 this bar is a very nice establishment .  the decor is nice ,  the bartender was friendly ,  it ' s like a sports bar . we came in to watch the cavs game last week and the bartender gave us free jello shots when they won , that was awesome ! there ' s free pool and a jukebox plus five big-screen tvs and it ' s nice and clean ! it ' s definitely a nice friendly place to meet with friends !  ! jones bones doing it right in the kitchen ! we had a mac&que bowl  which was macaroni and cheese layered with pulled pork and it was phenomenal !  i highly recommend this place for people who want to meet up with friends and have a drama free fun filled night ! 
__label__3 i was really impressed with this place .  the menu is really creative and it has a good beer list .  we went to watch a browns game .  the staff and customers were very nice and it had a great atmosphere .  my only complaints are they need a bigger draught beer list  ( they only had great lakes on tap )  and we took our 6 month old son ,  they didn ' t have highchairs and all the tables are high tops .  yes ,  i know it ' s technically a bar but we went during a 1:00 browns game and it would gave been nice to have some family friendly seating options . 
__label__5 the bartender was very friendly and the food was absolutely delicious .   back for my 2nd time and wont be my last .  shout out to the cook jeremy best macn cheese n greens i ever tasted .  .  . 
__label__4 the lion on lorain is a blue collar bar with class and yes ,  they have an elvis pinball machine .  yelpers  ( myself included )  can be some pretty tough critics so when i noticed that a bar in my neighborhood has 4 . 5 stars after 23 reviews i was intrigued .  how can this be ?  what makes them so special ?  well ,  my wife and i decided to end the speculation on a recent tuesday evening and pay them a visit .   we decided upon a tuesday for a couple of reasons; we don ' t like crowds and it was taco tuesday  ( $2 tacos !  )  .  we walked through the front door around 5:30 and there were only two other people at the bar .  the juke was pumping out some zeppelin and the biker-friendly vibe was evident .  harley-davidson inspired colors grace the walls with plenty of tin signage to match .  the rest of the space has a nice comfortable neighborhood bar vibe completely devoid of pretention and snobbery .  our server / bartender was very friendly and accommodating ,  greeting us with a smile as soon as we sat down .   i ' m a bit of a beer snob ,  a fact i wear proudly on my sleeve ,  so i ' ve gotta hit the beer list ,  or lack thereof .  the lion on lorain is not a beer bar .  they have five taps ,  one of which was not working on the eve of our visit ,  and the other four included shocktop sunset wheat ,  guinness ,  thirsty dog 12 dogs christmas ale  ( odd ,  i know )  ,  and kentucky bourbon barrel ale .  i ' ve gotta give it to them for at least having some unique brews on tap .  there were also some interesting craft bottles available but they keep them hidden behind the bar .  just a suggestion guys ,  print out a beer list .  your customers will thank you .   now on to the food .  the main reason for our visit was the taco tuesday promotion .  every tuesday they have a taco-only menu where you can choose from a handful of different varieties for $2 each .  not a bad deal if you ask me .  for this particular tt they had 9 soft tacos from which to choose .  here ' s what we sampled:  cordon bleu: pulled chicken topped with romaine lettuce ,  ham ,  swiss cheese and the lions '  own bbq sauce .  nothing like combining a taco with a ham and swiss sandwich to make you drool .  the chicken was tender and seasoned perfectly .   puerto rican: rice and beans topped with pulled pork ,  fresh morcilla  ( spanish black sausage )  ,  romaine lettuce and lion bbq sauce .  this was my wife ' s favorite .  the combination of the spicy sausage ,  black beans and rice were amazing .  i ' ve never been to puerto rico and probably never will but i ' d like to imagine if i did this is what their food would taste like .   the hipster: seasoned ground beef topped with romaine lettuce ,  fried salami ,  mozzarella / provolone cheese ,  and cajun aioli .  i think it was the fried salami that put this one over the top for me .  it was salty ,  slightly crispy on the edges and the cajun aioli added just the right amount of heat .  this is one taco i would never eat ironically .   shepherd ' s pie: seasoned ground beef topped with a slice of shepherd ' s pie ,  romaine lettuce ,  mozz / provo cheese and bbq sauce .  holy shit was this good .  i ' m pretty sure whoever came up with this one is a bit off ,  but i loved it .  the slightly sweet sauce went perfectly with the spicy beef .  it also made me wanna try the shepherd ' s pie on its own .   all in all these tacos were brilliant .  they were stuffed to overflowing with fresh ,  flavorful ingredients and the combinations were unique and memorable .  i was worried that i wouldn ' t be sated with a mere two tacos - i had nothing to worry about .  i also liked the side of chips and salsa .  if the rest of their menu is this good i can ' t wait to try it .   we had a pretty good time during our first visit to the lion on lorain .  the staff is friendly  ( thanks to jason ,  the owner ,  for coming by to introduce himself to us and tell us about the various specials they have during the week )  the tacos were delicious and the location is comfortable .  if i had to offer a few final words of suggestion i ' d say up the ante with the draught beer offering and more chips with the tacos ,  please . 
__label__4 cash only !   i am glad i read yelp reviews before i went otherwise i would have been totally confused .   they do not have a menu ,  it ' s a buffet with extras delivered to your table .   they served us mushroom soup to start and then we headed to the buffet which had  ( sorry i don ' t know polish terms )  cabbage rolls ,  a goulash ,  spaetzel ,  some veggie thing ,  and a potato bacon loaf .   while we were eating they served us very delicious potato pancakes and perogies .   and just when we thought we were done they brought out an apple strudel dessert .   this place is easy to pass by since it doesn ' t have the name on the outside of the building ,  there is just a tarp that says polish restaurant . 
__label__3 now ,  this is way out of the box for me generally speaking ,  since i am not a fan at all of eating anything that comes out of a gas station .  but i have to say i was mildly satisfied with the level of service received ,  and the food quality was actually on par and even slightly above my typical expectations of subway .  the foot long i ordered was fresh ,  the toppings did not look like they were really fresh ,  but unlike some other sub places i have dined at ,  these didn ' t look 2 weeks old either .  i recommend this subway over the other one on ridge and pearl or worst yet ,  the one located inside walmart on west ridge-wood drive . 
__label__4 awesome place ,  great for the quick healthy eats .   this place gets very very busy during lunch .   i advise calling in an order .   service is good and friendly ,  prices are fair .   i have had the kefta sandwich ,  and another time had shawerma sandwich ,  both were perfect .   i will def come back here again . 
__label__1 i work at uh ,  so it ' s conveniently located and the positive yelp feedback made me think it could be a good lunch option .  the first time i went there ,  i ordered noodles with tofu and lemongrass spiked chicken broth .  while it was tasty ,  it was a meal that i easily could have created at home for less than half of the price .  i also didn ' t love that there wasn ' t enough broth to be much of a soup  ( maybe i misinterpreted what i was getting .  .  .  )  .    take 2 ,  i tried teahouse again for lunch today and ordered the veggie bowl with chicken and rica rica sauce .  while the sauce was really good ,  the veggies and chicken were swimming in the sauce .  .  .  . there was at least an inch of sauce at the bottom of my takeout container .  i found myself straining the veggies and "ringing them out" with my fork .  .  . not something you should need to do with a good meal .  so much for a healthy lunch - i feel like i just ingested an unnecessary few hundred calories worth of sauce  ( i don ' t even want to think about the sodium )  .    i wish the food was better .  there ' s a good chance i ' m just not ordering the right thing ,  but i don ' t want to waste any more money or calories playing roulette trying to figure out the winning combinations . 
__label__5 awesome spot and just what that area needed .  great breakfast and killer hotdogs .  the bacon wrapped deep fried dog is a must .    finally a place to get a real hotdog close to home .  it ' s clean ,  the people are friendly and good food .  check this place out ! 
__label__1 business is closed .   yelp won ' t publish the three word review so i ' ll reiterate: it ' s closed . 
__label__4 we had driven past carpet warehouse for years and when it finally came to buying new carpet ,  it was honestly the last place we thought about going .    we walked in randomly on the way home from going to some of the "big name" carpet places and thought "what the heck let ' s check it out . "  first impression .  .  .  . wow the "show room" was not very organized .   set your expectations correctly ,  this is a warehouse of carpet .   you wont have any glitz and glam like you will at some of the stores but think about it .  .  .  .  . you are looking for carpet not show room glitz .   their pricing was fantastic .    we found the same name brand carpet we looked at in other show rooms for significantly less .   they had lots of selection although it took some digging to find the best fit .   we worked with sal and he was fantastic .      we decided to pull the trigger and man are we happy that we did .   install was very professional and they did a great job .     don ' t judge a book by it ' s cover .   i will buy carpeting from them again in the future . 
__label__2 oh man ,  i really don ' t like giving out bad reviews ,  but this place could use some work !  !  the hostess seemed down right annoyed at our presence ,  and our server was barely better .  we ordered the calamari and it was painfully under cooked .  i ordered the house mojito  ( a mojito with cucumber )  and there was almost no ice ,  and the mint leaves had just been dumped in without any sort of muddling .  this basically made the drink taste like a warm cucumber soaked in rum .  i had the crab cake as an entree and it was soggy in the middle and didn ' t taste exactly fresh .  i do give one star for a great view and one star for prompt service ,  even though a second drink was requested by someone else in our party and it never came . 
__label__5 amazing west coast oyster and calm chowder just as amazing !  oysters are a must-try . 
__label__3 i ' m sad to give this only 3 stars  ( i wish i could give it 2 . 5 stars )  because i had very high hopes for alley cat since the location & ambiance are one of a kind in cleveland but the service was not very friendly and the food wasn ' t the greatest .  my husband and i got the stuffed oysters ,  the philly sushi roll ,  and the lobster roll .  the stuffed oysters were pretty good but there were only 4 for about $12-14 .  the philly roll was very underwhelming and was a warm  ( not cold )  temperature which made us very nervous .  i was a fan of the lobster roll ,  it was fresh and good quality but my husband oddly did not like it .  overall ,  we had just an okay experience but like i said the staff wasn ' t very friendly and the food not very impressive . 
__label__2 only three oysters to choose from .   no one was avaialble to tell me what was what on my plate .   baked oysters were heated and thats about it .   they need a chargrilled option .   raw were fine but the oysters were not even shucked properly .   service was not great .   if you have never been to a real oyster house then you might like it .  if you have been to real oyster houses in other parts of the country then you probably will go here one time and never go back . 
__label__2 went with a group of friends  ( 4 total )  for dinner on a tuesday night .  restaurant is very trendy and i ' d even say hipsterish .  the decor is beautiful and being able to look out onto the water is a great addition to dinner .  it was packed even on a tuesday night with no events going on downtown .  we were seated at a table by the bar .  there is a nice bar with big screen tvs that were showing a tennis match .    they bring out bread and olive oil to start .  the olive oil was of course zack bruell ' s own .  it was good but the bread was crusty to the point where you ' d cut your gums on it .  the next time they brought out bread it was nice and soft inside but crusty outside .    while we had several visits to bring bread or refill our water we did not see our server until at least 30 min .  after we arrived .  she apologized and took our drink and food order promptly .  the food took quite a while to arrive .   we of course ordered the oysters as a starter .  the menu online shows a dozen varieties but the actual menu had half a dozen varieties .  then the server explained they only had 3 varieties .  pretty slim pickings for an "oyster bar" .  it took quite a while for the oysters and food to arrive .  the oysters were great although pricey at around $3 each .  served with the traditional accompaniments .  i ordered the perch sandwich because of the rave reviews .  it came with a mountain of fries .  the fries were great but the sandwich not so much ,  i was only able to eat about half of it because the fish was extremely greasy leading me to believe it was not fried at the proper temperature .  my friend ' s lobster roll looked much better and he said it was quite good .    i can ' t fully recommend this place but i ' m willing to give them another try .  i hope that they do better next time . 
__label__4 setting is its best attribute as the views are nice and the interior is great as well .  may be because the place was pretty empty but we had very friendly and attentive service .  one letdown would be only 3 oyster varities and no west coast choices but the blue points we got were shucked nicely and i loved the mingonette .  shrimp stuffed peppers were a twist that i really liked ,  only wish they used bigger shrimp inside .  the whole fish had good flavor with the vinaigrette but it was a little overdone itself .  overall i enjoyed the meal but maybe a little pricey for the quality of the food
__label__4 i ' m very surprised that the alley cat oyster bar ' s overall rating is only a 3 !  i thought the food here was amazing and it had a great ambiance !  good to note: i came here on a sunday night with my dad and sister after spending the day at the cleveland art museum .  we only ordered drinks and appetizers ,  but it was enough to be a full meal .   one quick negative aspect of this restaurant is their inconsistency about their hours .  which are ,  you know ,  kind of important .  their website doesn ' t even list the hours which to me ,  in this day and age ,  is annoying .  when you google it says 11:30 am - 8:00 pm on sundays .  thankfully ,  i called in advance to ask their sunday hours and the hostess said they didn ' t open until 4:00 pm .   despite this ,  the food was beyond good !  !  we ordered the following appetizers to share: clam chowder  ( new england style )  ,  seafood cocktail  ( shrimp ,  scallops ,  squid ,  chilled spicy tomato broth )  ,  alley cat ceviche  ( tostones )  ,  shrimp stuffed peppers  ( rock shrimp ,  spicy mayo ,  queso fresco ,  soy sauce{very hot ! } )  ,  and the iceberg  ( tomato ,  cucumber ,  avocado ,  egg ,  miso ranch and i added fried rock shrimp )  .  all of these dishes went so well together i would even recommend ordering exactly these if you ' re a hungry party of 3 !    the iceberg salad and the seafood cocktail stand out to me the most .  the fried shrimp paired with the cold lettuce and ranch dressing was sooo good !  the cocktail was a very liquid-y mixture of all the seafood and vegetables  ( i was expecting similar to shrimp cocktail )  and it was  served in a cocktail glass .  you use a spoon to dish it out .  these two were by far my favorite ,  but every single dish was amazing ! 
__label__3 good dining environment with a great location - right by the water in the flats .  food way overpriced ,  and should be much better for the price you are paying .  decent appetizers ,  entrees subpar .  after coming here multiple times ,  wouldn ' t recommend for the entrees or for dinner . 
__label__3 starting with the food .   alley cat ceviche - very good with tomatoes ,  avocados and plantains chips .  seafood bisque another winner .  not too thick with a bit of spice kick .  several in my party ordered the seafood quesadilla and loved it .  my fish sandwich ,  was lightly breaded and not greasy .  i forgot to have them hold the house grain mustard  ( dijon )  so my first bite left a bitter taste .   had to ask for a new bun - which my sandwich became cold by the time they replaced it .   this was served with way too many fries .  it was about 3cups worth .  not necessary ,  i would probably ask to substitute if i were to order it again .  i though that the fresh fish was priced way to high .  nothing was below $30 .   flats: expect to pay $10 for valet ,  $7 . 50 to self-park .  i am glad to see this area is getting a make over ,  but for me it will not be a weekly spot with the pricing . 
__label__3 talk about rushed .    we were seated given bread and water and took the drink order .   at the same time asked about appetizers and those requests were taken as well .    within 2 minutes the appetizer was at our table which means they were already prepared .   no biggie because apps can be quick but not when they are fried and have to be cooked .   immediately came over and asked for dinner order .   i ' m not joking but literally 4 minutes later they were at our table with entrees .   i still had the appetizer plates on our tiny table .   still no drink that i ordered initially .   the food was reminiscent of a food truck .   lobster roll was fancier buttered and toasted hot dog bun with a few pieces of what i think was lobster in it .   and a gargantuan helping of french fries to fill up the plate .   most fries were clumped together and over cooked .   again evidence that everything seemed precooked .   overall overpriced for the food quality and speed .   don ' t order the lobster roll .   clam chowder was good .   nice location and beautiful view .   sit outside if you decide to eat here . 
__label__4 pros -location ,  location ,  location .  with the rise of the flats ,  alley cat is one of the big winners when it comes to location .  they are right next to the boardwalk / river and the majority of tables have a view of the cuyahoga river .  the opening of the garage-style windows instantly make the indoors feel like a patio .  -see food ,  seafood .  probably one of the biggest seafood menus in the cleveland area ,  imo .  they had 5-6 catches of the day ,  including my fav ,  tuna  ( which i got )  .  they have an oyster menu .  and then more entrees that include seafood .  so if you like seafood ,  you have plenty of options .  -calamari .  one of the better calamari dishes i ' ve had in awhile .  i am not a fan of red sauce with calamari ,  so i was happy to find that this was served with an aioli .  there was something else spicy on the side  ( i avoided it )  .  and large leafs of cilantro .  all dishes should be served with large leafs of cilantro .  -tuna .  while it was not the best tuna i ' ve ever had in my life ,  it was still pretty solid .  i would recommend ordering it as rare as it comes .   cons -shooter ' s ,  go home ,  you ' re drunk .  when your across-the-river neighbor is shooter ' s ,  aka that frat house who leaves beer cans in the front yard ,  you ' re gonna run into some hiccups .  as i mentioned above ,  the garage doors open to make it feel like a patio .  while we were there ,  alley cat had to close the doors ,  not because of weather ,  but because shooter ' s music was so loud that it was disrupting the atmosphere at alley cat .  -seafood .  i ' m just throwing it out there in case you don ' t like seafood .  the menu is mostly made up of creatures from the sea ,  so if that ' s not your thing ,  your options will be limited .   bottom line i see food ,  you see food ,  we all seafood .  and then want to eat that food in this cool and trendy restaurant . 
__label__4 fantastic new spot !  the food is fresh and wonderful !  the meals were unique and prepared with a lot of care .  we started with oysters and two of the salads that were wonderful .  the grilled broccoli cesar was unexpectedly amazing !  we had the seafood salad ,  tuna entree ,  fish sandwich and the grilled octopus .  we were too full for desert .  service was impeccable and the views made us feel like we were on vacation .  we can ' t wait to return . 
__label__3 as a huge fan of zack b .  restaurants with l ' albatros being my favorite and parallax being my second favorite ,  this one is right in line in terms of quality .  i visited this establishment this past saturday with my husband .  my tuna tasted fresh and was cooked perfectly rare atop a bed of edamame with a  ( i think )  balsamic soy dressing .  we also ordered the oysters rock which were delicious .  my husband had the burger with fries .  the burger had carrots on it which was not to my liking and it tasted like the fries were fried in duck fat .  the fries were good and the bun that the burger was on was good too .  i had a generous wine pour and my husband said his martini was excellent .  the food was great ,  however ,  the server was very low energy and lack luster .  she seemed very disengaged . 
__label__4 my server was the best waiter i ' ve ever had .  .  .  anywhere in the country .   the clam chowder is very tasty .  i also had the raw oysters .  .  .  happy hour special for the win .  sooo good .    the main course - their amazing lobster roll .  warm ,  buttery ,  and delicious .  comes with old bay fries .   great food ,  great view on the water . 
__label__5 solid choice for a night out in cleveland .   i visited in late october ,  but i can imagine that the scene here would be very cool in warmer weather - right along the river with indoor / outdoor flex options for seating .    during my visit ,  it was in the 40s outside ,  so indoor seating for us .   i went with a group from work so it was a slightly different experience as we had a set menu ,  and i wasn ' t paying so i can ' t speak to prices .   here ' s what i did experience: --really friendly wait staff ,  including a nice visit from the manager to check to ensure we had a positive dining experience --extensive drink menu ,  especially beer and wine ,  which you would expect from a bar / restaurant ,  and it did not disappoint !   great options for all diners --tasty food: many eateries tend to cater towards more general appetite appeal ,  on many dishes here ,  they were packing the heat !   flavorful and spicy .   my coworkers raved about shrimp stuffed peppers .   if you ' re planning an evening in downtown cle ,  especially when the weather is nice ,  this place is a great option . 
__label__5 i came to alley cat with my sister on a busy friday night ,  and it is as good as it gets !  we made a reservation via open table and hung out at the bar while we waited for our table to open up .  we had a delightful experience .  we ordered various cocktails ,  all equally as tasty .  our bartender had a good sense of humor and did an excellent job staying aware of his guests at the bar ,  even though he appeared to be extremely busy .  in terms of food ,  i ordered the calamari to start and the seafood quesadilla as my entrie .  both were awesome .  i will be craving that quesadilla all the time now !  mike ,  the manager ,  stopped at our table to assure that we were completely satisfied .  .  . and we were !  we informed him that we were from out of town and he suggested places we might want to stop and see after our dinner .  two thumbs up !  alley cat deserves an a+ and i will definitely be back soon !  ! 
__label__5 absolutely the best lobster roll in cleveland  !  !   if you like lobster rolls you must try this place .  it ' s going to cost you but it ' s with it . 
__label__4 great views of the cleveland bridges and the waterfront .  the oysters were great .  the snap pea salad and seafood quesadillas were really tasty as well .  the lobster roll was lackluster .  modern ambience with good service .  the east bank area has built up some good steam and looks to only get better with time .  alley cat has a prime location within the new east bank .  i ' ll be coming back
__label__1 one word nasty !  there ' s always police getting calls here and rooms are gross half the time air conditions don ' t work and there are women that like to come up and offer stuff .  good thing it ' s not so pricey but also not the cleanest motel .  i wouldn ' t allow my dog to sleep here . 
__label__1 checked in around midnight from a long day of traveling .  the room was minimally clean but i was exhausted so i thought i could manage for a night .  about half an hour later a cracked out man decided to come persistently knock on my door and try to get in ,  along with the room next door .  then !  i decided to check for bed bugs ,  and what do you know ?  maroon / brownish clusters on the underside of the mattress .  i went to the front desk and the girl wouldn ' t do anything .  only explained that it ' s policy for terminx to come and prove if it was true or not before issuing a refund .  after dealing with the gm ,  and determining somehow i was wrong ,  i could not get my money back .  some of the worst customer service i have ever experienced .  do not stay here !  ! 
__label__5 you need to stop here !  staff is friendly and give great advice .  they have some really nice brands that are unique to their store and you can ' t find anywhere else .  prices are reasonable .  best boutique in tremont !  ! 
__label__5 this place is an all star !  i call it pet spa .  my little friend loves this place and the staff are so friendly and knowledgeable .  i just like the fact that they keep your pets till they get comfortable about their environment and then they bath your pet .  they have really comfortable tools and accessories for you to bath your dogs by yourself as well .  great place .  .  . 
__label__3 excellent food and service with a great menu .  tons of choices with a friendly staff .  i ' m blind and my server had knowledge of the clock method for a person like me to enjoy my meal !  ! 
__label__4 it ' s rare to find a restaurant that serves both greek and indian food .   this place is good for both dine-in and takeout .   i ' ve ordered a large number of both the greek and indian dishes .   some dishes are good and some dishes are very good .   i most recently had the roasted kasseri chicken entree .   the sauce was great and the two large pieces of chicken were well cooked .   overall the dish was very rich .   the indian food is tasty - not my favorite indian food ,  but good .   i ' ve eaten the butter chicken ,  pakoras ,  and samosas and have left satisfied .    you can order the indian entrees here on a 1-7 spice scale .   the chutney has a reasonable amount of spice and a level 6 entree is actually spicy .   i had some of the baklava ice cream for dessert and thought that the baklava could have been a little better .     portion sizes here are generous .   the waiter seemed fairly new ,  but he was very friendly and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time . 
__label__1 my husband took me to this restaurant for my birthday .  i was excited as i love greek food ,  but admit i am picky as my grandparents immigrated from greece .  service was awful .  the server did not know the menu and rarely came over to check on us .  the food was very americanized .  my husband ordered a plate that was supposed to contain artichokes ,  but had brussels sprouts instead .  we asked the waiter if they had run out of artichokes ,  and he said ,  no those are a new type of artichoke .   completely lied to us .  save your money for one of the awesome greek festivals instead . 
__label__4 i ' ve had nothing but good experiences at mad greek .  they are not just a greek restaurant ,  but have an indian fushion that has been incorporated since the owner married an indian woman .  and it has done great things for the food !  the chicken curry flatbread is just plain yummy and the owner is very friendly and courteous .  the service is good and i ' d go back in a heartbeat ! 
__label__3 i use groupon quite a bit for restaurant deals and decided to try this place since i had a taste for indian food and have not had it in awhile .  my son was with me and he was game to try something new .  upon entering my first thought was the place looked dated  and tired ,  it was also empty but the patio had some people eating .  my son wanted to sit outside and so we did .  our server was very nice .  i order the chicken tikka with a side salad and my son got the shrimp rangoon .  i also order a beer .  i got a semi chilled glass and a barely cold bottle of beer which turned warm rather quickly with the outside temperature .  the food came pretty quickly but our server forgot to bring the side salad out first so i ended up asking for it .  my chicken was good ,  flavor wise and spice wise but the chicken itself was not tender .  my son liked the shrimp but didn ' t care much for the curry .  overall the prices are a little high for the size of the portions .  the service was just okay and the atmosphere was also just okay .  would i go back ?  hmmm ,  maybe .  .  .  ? 
__label__3 pros: broad menu including indian and greek food--something for everyone ,  friendly service ,  pleasant atmosphere .  recommend the gyro plate ,  soups ,  indian curries .  reasonably priced for a nice place .  cons: some food--hummus ,  baba ganoush--was a little meh ,  especially for a place called the mad greek .  not bad ,  just not great . 
__label__3 the food is a little bit on the expensive side ,  but i ' ve enjoyed my meal the two times i ' ve been there .    the lemon chicken is some of the best i ' ve had ,  but the portion size wasn ' t gigantic ,  so i ' m not sure it was really worth the price .    the atmosphere isn ' t the most romantic of all restaurants - it seems like they ' re trying ,  but they ' re just not quite there .    i ' ve been there twice ,  and it ' s been good ,  but not that good for what you pay . 
__label__1 stay away !  beware !  the worst restaurant ever !  this is the filthiest , most disgusting ,  smells of cockroaches and the servers ,  manager etc are rude ,  obnoxious ,  dirty and sloppy .    my wife and i went for a nice dinner and this place was filthy ,  had bugs and we were treated horribly  in all of our years ,  we have never experienced something as bad as this !   avoid this restaurant at any cost !  free is too expensive ! 
__label__1 ok .  i would put this  ( the mad greek )  down to a zero if i could now .   just got a message from either a customer service rep or the owner of the restaurant essentially telling me i didn ' t know what i was talking about ,  that both dishes had tomato curry and were meant to be the same and that they had been covering their indian dishes with raisins and almonds for 30 years .  they went on to "wish me luck in my efforts to slander good restaurants ,  and they were sure it wouldn ' t come back to bite me" .   what are you going to do .  .  .  block your years and sing so you don ' t have to read pitiful yelp reviews ?    let me explain a base principle / secret of "tomato curry" to you .  curry ,  for indian food ,  simply means a sauce based in the word before it .  so a tomato curry is a tomato based gravy that can be a multitude of things !  it ' s like calling an arrabiata ,  a marinara and a puttanesca sauce all the same because they are tomato sauces .  there is meant to be a distinct difference in flavors .  and chickpeas ,  mushrooms and whatover leftover vegetables are left in the kitchen have as much place in a bengal fish or a tasty tomato curry paneer as ketchup does in a chocolate covered vanilla ice cream !   seriously .  .  .  the owners need to grow up ,  accept the fact that i had a terrible time at their place and either deal with or ,  or try to improve the experience .  telling me i ' m an idiot for not truly appreciating their food and that my "slander would catch up to me" is just stupid !    for reference - other people ' s reviews: " this dish came heaping w /  white rice that wasn ' t cooked appropriately  ( i ' m sorry ,  if my rice is crunching it isn ' t done .  )  and a very small portion of the cauliflower curry .   cauliflower is cheap people ,  for $15 i expect more than 1 c .  of veggies . "  "not good at all .  i had the greek ,  she had the indian .  just moved to town from the rockies and i ' ve had greek food all over the world .  this was ,  by far ,  the worst !  i ' ve had better greek food on a ferry .  the place was not clean and had the feeling that they were about to close .  server was ok but knew zero about greek cuisine .  .  .  in fact ,  the kitchen knew zero about greek cuisine !  "  need i go on ?   give this place a miss and you and your date / company will thank yourselves for it !   update: this review is my opinion ,  and in my opinion ,  this place sucks .  but then again ,  this is my opinion .  stating that explicitly  ( even though the yelp ' s online contract states that every thing that is posted is pure opinion only )  because the owner just sent me a message threatening yelp and me with a lawsuit .  poor guy can ' t get his head around the fact that most people here think his restaurant sucks !  go somewhere else !  ! 
__label__1 it just wouldn ' t be a wednesday night if i wasn ' t woken up by the sound of extremely inebriated patrons of the money bar & grill screaming at each other while some of them are brawling violently in the parking lot and then dangerously stopping traffic by rolling into the busy memphis ave at 12:38 am .     last night was an especially memorable experience ,  as i was stolen from my dreams once again to the sound of blood-curdling female screams and loud choppers speeding away as glass bottles were thrown at the drivers .   i peeked out the window to find a man engaged in sloppy hand-to-hand combat with a woman in the middle of memphis ave while another woman was lying down in the parking lot crying .   after about 10 minutes of this display of cars screeching to a halt before running over the two scrapping in the street  ( in other words ,  quite long enough to realize that no other patrons or employees of the establishment were interested in calling the police ,  especially since dina ' s three doors down always has an officer inside the bar and is filled with off-duty cops and would be there in no-time if a call was made )  ,  some onlookers from inside the bar seemed to be enjoying the scene as one repeatedly yelled ,  "suck his dick" about 17 times at the top of his lungs .    scenes like this are not at all uncommon for weeknights at the monkey .   i have never actually been in the establishment ,  but i do live within 300 yards of it and witness such behavior literally on a weekly basis .   on a good night ,  you are only subjected to screaming threats of violence from over-served patrons and the sound of ten or so motorcycles revving their engines for a while before speeding off ,  the noise of which is akin to trying to sleep next to a very large scale civil war reenactment for 25 minutes at a time .   i could agree to add a star to this review for every week they go without a loud ,  violent scene similar to this and i ' d never have to worry about updating it .    if you have children ,  are thinking of having children ,  know anyone that has children ,  or if you were ever a child ,  do not come anywhere near this classless venue of terrifying lawless behavior .   if there was a god ,  the city would knock this place down and plant a tree or something .   but clearly ,  the monkey bar & grill proves that there is no such entity . 
__label__1 no bike rack .  won ' t let you bring your bike inside ,  even when there are only 3 people there .  bar mistress  ( with nothing to do because 3 customers )  yells at you from across the bar .  does not politely come over and apologize .  doesn ' t say "only one but then you have to go" .  yells at you .  only have budweiser .  for a neighborhood bar they are working really hard to keep the neighborhood out .  every street in this part if town has a dedicated bike lane full of bikers .  learn who your clients are if you ' re going to run a neighborhood bar . 
__label__5 they do quality work here and are always willing to explain things .  they are even open to allowing you to find your own parts if you can find them cheaper .  my family has been using them for years .  trustworthy ,  hard working ,  and fair .  worth the expense . 
__label__4 a few friends and i decided to hang out here ,  before our dinner reservation at lolita  ( which is half a block away )  .   this is the perfect place to hang out and have a few laid back drinks ,  whether before dinner ,  or after dinner .  its not too dressy ,  but you wouldnt be out of place being a little dressed up either .   the menu is pretty extensive - instead of looking through all the liquor and wine ,  i decided to stick with the cocktails  .   .   .  which were amazing .  i had a bellini-tini and a pomegranate mojito .   i downed them ,  literally thinking there was no alcohol in either of my drinks  .   .   until i got to dinner and realized that they definitely did have alcohol in them .  they were that delicious !  and fairly reasonably priced .   the decor of the wine bar is interesting .  perhaps a little off-beat ,  but nothing off-putting .  antique looking chairs ,  some animal prints ,  fireplace ,  dark wood ,  old-fashioned bar .  it does feel very intimate ,  and there are little rooms in the back with couches that are very comfortable .  this is a great place to chill as a group or for an intimate date .    i didn ' t get to try the apps ,  but i ' m not sure i would be going to a place like this for the apps anyway .  the drinks are where its at . 
__label__5 love this place !  !  !  ! great atmosphere ,  music ,  staff ,  cocktails .   not to mention the best patio in cleveland . 
__label__5 give me a long list of different types of martinis ,  and i ' m a happy girl .  throw in some couches ,  a lot of space ,  places to cozy with your date ,  and friendly staff at the bar in front ,  and you might have yourself one of the best places to go in cleveland on a date .  or just with your friends .  or when you need a good martini .  or when you just need a drink after a hard day .  or when you want to make out on the couch .  what ?  maybe minus that last one .  .  .  .  . 
__label__4 you know ,  it ' s tough to argue with a weeknight outing at 806 when the weather is 78 degrees ,  no humidity ,  sipping a glass of wine on the outdoor patio .   i can only speak to the wine menu--it ' s pretty good sized .   tuesday nights will get you a glass of pinot grigio or merlot for a meager $3 . 00 .   yep ,  read it and weep !   what a steal .   cool indoor vibe that almost reminds me of a mini version of velvet tango room  ( but that place is in a class all by itself .  .  .  )   food looked good but didn ' t try it .   a great reason to return to 806 .  .  . 
__label__1 this location is by far the worst location ever .   we from work go their almost everyday .   product is never consistent   coffee is usually below dunkin donut standards .  they fail to follow simple instructions   owner is full of excuses and willing to do nothing  (  complimentary product or train staff properly  )  .  today was the worst as i dared to ask for cup holder for my three coffees   i was told it will be a charge in future for the cup holder .  that ' s it i am done
__label__3 convenient location ,  with nice drive through .   not really a donut fan ,  but love their drinks ,  flatbread and breakfast sandwiches .   friendly service that keeps you moving . 
__label__4 simple ,  delicious ,  affordable .  the owner ,  i think ,  was our server ,  and he recommended meals according to our preferences .  this is a very family-run ,  dive-type place with an unassuming facade that could easily go unnoticed on trendy w 25th--don ' t let it !  the food is authentic ,  the service sincere ,  and i will be back . 
__label__5 just walked down the street to try phnom penh for the first time ,  and i ' m already thinking about walking back down there to order more !  !   it is definitely vegetarian and vegan friendly ,  just ask the standard questions and all will be good .   there are literally over 100 items on the menu ,  which is overwhelming but gives me over 100 reasons to go back !   i tried chha kreoung with vegetables and fried tofu and chose "hot" for level of spiciness .  it ' s certainly spicy !  !  i can just imagine how wonderful that will be on some cold ,  snowy winter day .  anyway ,  it ' s spicy ,  but i love spice .   although it is spicy ,  there ' s definitely a lot of other flavors going on in there .  the description for this dish: "an exotic flavor ,  mixture of lime leaves ,  garlic ,  turmeric root ,  galanga root and lemon grass .  .  .  stirred with onion ,  green or red pepper ,  chunky chopped roasted peanuts with steamed rice . "  i had hoped i would have leftovers for lunch tomorrow ,  but i ' m beginning to doubt that !   p . s .  they *do* take credit cards for orders $15 and up  ( although mine was $10 they still took my card )  even though the menus say no credit cards . 
__label__5 holy mother of mary ,  jesus ,  and any other gods you can think of ,  the food is hot !  !  but then ,  i should have known better than order it extra spicy .  my other two dining mates knew better and ordered their food medium .  but ,  being the snob that i am  ( kidding ,  i am a very pleasant person in real life ,  this is all a persona )  ,  i had to say "make mine spicy ,  extra spicy" .  .  .  .  . oh ,  and they did .  i can hear the conversation going on in the kitchen:  waiter: two mild ,  one extra spicy .    chef: extra spicy ?  for real ?  nobody orders regular spicy and this one wants it extra spicy ?   waiter: yep ,  the indian ova there probably thinks he is da sh*t .  he thinks he can handle our spices just because he is indian .    chef: oh hell no !  !   waiter: let ' s show him some cambodian love ,  with extra spices  chef: i ' ve got it covered .  just make sure he doesn ' t start screaming after the first bite .    waiter: i ' ve got the fire extinguisher ready    so ,  our food arrives .  i ordered the taprom: sweet and sour flavored cambodian dish with fresh mushrooms ,  onions ,  scallions ,  napa ,  green peppers ,  in a light lemongrass sauce ,  and tamarind ,  with chicken .  .  .  . extra spicy .  the dish looked red .  i tells ya ,  it looked like fire .   and then i took the first bite with some rice .  mmmm ,  tasty .  took few more bites .  mmmm ,  chomp ,  chomp .  .  . nice .  .  .  . wussies ,  they were trying to scare me with their spice factor .    that is when the fire hit .  first my lips started burning ,  then my tongue ,  then my throat ,  i felt like my insides were on fire .  damn ,  that felt good !  !  i haven ' t felt that good since i ate in the motherland .  this is what real heat feels like and i am glad i ordered it .  needless to say ,  i finished the entire dish .  it was incredible .   my friends got the chha kreoung ma rass prowt .  i know ,  right ?  !  ?  !  let me explain it to you .  it is an exotic flavor ,  mixture of lime leaves ,  garlic ,  turmeric root ,  galanga root ,  coconut whip ,  mass rass prowh  ( a special vegetable from asia )  ,  and lemon grass; stirred with onion ,  green or red pepper ,  chunky chopped roasted peanuts with chicken and served with rice .  they ordered it mild .  .  . wussies !    that ' s right people ,  the food is not only good ,  it is complicated !  !   let ' s just say the dish with complicated name was incredible .  the flavors blended quite well giving it an indescribable taste .  it was phenomenal .  the chunky roasted peanuts drizzled on top made it extra special .    overall ,  an out-of-this world dining experience in a very unpretentious setting .  love the simple and beautiful decor .  service is impeccable ,  they came often to check on us .  in fact ,  for a second ,  our waiter got worried when i started to sweat .  i had to assure him i am ok .   one last bonus point: it is byob .    totally worth setting your insides on fire ! 
__label__3 i got take out chicken curry and a rice noodle dish very similar to pad thai .   the curry was more like what would be considered malay curry at mint cafe ,  which is definitely fine with me .    i think the food is better than average .  i ' ve had apps and entrees there .  the heat level is inconsistent - i ' ve had blisteringly hot and i ' ve had pretty tame heat on the same dish on different occasions .   the service is good ,  the decor is cool .  i ' m glad to see the irish bar and middle eastern food stranglehold on w .  25th be broken . 
__label__1 absolutely the worst pho i ' ve ever had in my life !   extremely small portion for $8 and was completely bland .   i asked to return it politely and was treated very rudely . 
__label__4 i love the food here .  the food here is really tasty and super inexpensive for the quality and quanity .   if you ' ll not be shy then the staff can share their favorite dishes or the most traditional or what other diners rave about .   i have had the pad thai and some other noodle dishes that were good but the item i get most often is a very traditionals cambodian bowl of noodles and it has a spring roll chopped up on top .   give them that description and they ' ll be able to point it out to you .   the menu is huge so take your time and then point to something on the menu and press  ' go '  !   the environment is very ,  very basic so don ' t go there to have a great ambiance or comfy seats to sit and gab with friends or  family .   oh ,  and most important is to check out their hours because more than one we ' ve arrived to a closed door .   the other need to know factoid is that this is a cash only operation so to be sure you don ' t spend the evening washing dishes to earn your meal . 
__label__4 i just checked out phnom penh with my hubby and a few friends last night - i absolutely loved it !  i believe the name of the dish i ordered was banh sougnh .  .  it had rice noodles ,  chicken ,  cut up pieces of egg rolls ,  and a peanutty-coconut milk sauce .  i asked for mild ,  and it had very little spiciness - i might ask for medium next time .  i also ordered the jackfruit and coconut blended drink and it was delicious - kind of melon-like ,  with the sweetness of a banana .  wow !  i would definitely go back and take some friends or family .  the restaurant is fairly big with some fun southeast asian decorations ,  and although it ' s not fancy by any means  ( and it ' s totally affordable )  ,  it would be a good place to take out-of-towners or to go for an affordable and fun date night . 
__label__1 my gf got sick from the mixed seafood .  i thought i ' d give this another chance because i do have good memories of eating here as a kid .   i had a chicken and noodles dish .  you know that flavor of a really good bite of chicken say ,  from like a nice chicken breast ?  on the contrary ,  how about that rubbery ,  disgusting ,  chicken from a can chicken taste ?  that ' s the flavor i was getting from the chicken in their stir fry .  it was pretty much unbearable ,  i had to mask it with siracha sauce to no avail .    i think the phnom penh experience is over for me guys . 
__label__3 great authentic food .  the biggest issue is poor service .  went for dinner last night two of the waiters sat in the corner eating and on there laptops . this has always been an issue ,  which could explain the vacant dining room most of the time .  if the staff is not on their ipads  or laptops they are attending to their children  who have a playroom set up in the restaurant .  going forward it will only be take out in this dark gloomy restaurant . 
__label__4 this place is relatively inexpensive and the staff here is very nice .  the late hours they keep are great ! 
__label__5 as  le femme mystique we hope that you enjoy our shows to the extreme ,  we go far and wide to find you the best entertainment  the burlesque ,  vaudeville and variety have to offer .  we bring national and international talent to cleveland and not only do we kill it on stage we help our community by fundraising and volunteering to make sure we grow our home for the better . 
__label__2 big burger ,  but my rye was not toasted ,  tomato missing ,  and fries were overcooked and greasy .   slow service too . 
__label__3 for years the international exposition  ( i-x )  center has been one of the cleanest and most well-maintained convention venues i ' ve been in .   generally it ' s like a giant no-frills aircraft hangar with plenty of indoor floor space to completely contain large "supershows" like amusement parks ,  rv ,  boat ,  car ,  home & garden shows and expos .   it is located just outside of city of cleveland limits at cleveland hopkins international airport  ( cle )  ,  convenient for folks in western cuyahoga and eastern lorain counties .    lots of indoor food venues  ( pricey )  including beer and a subways stand  ( although every time we are there it seems that most of them are closed )  .   first aid station on site .   and ,  for some reason ,  has its own indoor ferris wheel and zip line .   ample paid parking - no free parking options anywhere close enough to walk from .   what i dislike are the exorbitant costs for both attendees and exhibitioners .   i ' ve seen parking range from $8 to $20 a car  ( that ,  of course ,  doesn ' t include price of admission )  .   recently ,  a vendor explained his price of admission for attending the show - strictly the floor space to park his rvs - was $70 , 000 for a few days .   i understand there ' s a cost in keeping this facility as well-maintained as it is but somebody ' s making buku bucks .  .  . 
__label__4 i came from pittsburgh to experience the fabulous food show at the i / x center this weekend ,  saturday to be exact .  i had come to this event last year as well and i think this year was just as positive .  several celebrity chefs were there-tyler florence , carla hall , michael symon to name a few .  they did cooking demonstrations that were cool to watch .  this is a huge venue that houses a ton of vendors for events like this .  at the front was a craft fair that was free admission .  in the center was the beer pavilion the beer pavilion was cool-$15 could get you six samples of beer , wine , liquor in any combo you wanted .  i tried some great ontario beers and some wonderful five finger lake region wines .  the food trucks ranged from tacos to german fare to sliders to a truck specializing in risotto balls .  i sampled a beef brisket slider that was tasty .  tickets were $2 each and most food items were between 2 and 4 tickets .  all of the vendors were set up in the middle to offer samples or explain their products .  highlights for myself included: yuengling pulled pork ,  daisy cakes  ( chocolate cake , carrot cake , and red velvet-delish icing )  , heavenly dips  ( shrimp cocktail dip is amazing )  ,  cleveland jams  ( jam made with glb beer )  , and graeter ' s ice cream . this is a great event each year and i ' m already looking forward to next year ! 
__label__4 really like this place ,  but the prices are a little high  ( i guess they have to make that up since they are giving the gas discounts )   but the pharmacy has the best deals of all .   get all my meds there for usually $4 .   they work with you to find the best price  ( via generic ,  or whatever )   their sales are pretty good ,  and you don ' t have to buy the quantity ,  so if it says to for $6 ,  you can buy one for $3 . 
__label__1 usually at a grocery store like giant eagle ,  i don ' t have the highest expectations for customer service .  however ,  this giant eagle has surpassed my expectations for terrible customer service .  my credit card  ( which i used both before and after at other establishments )  wouldn ' t swipe ,  so the clerk and manager both tried jamming my card into a plastic bag and swiping it ,  and refused to just punch the numbers in .  when i asked why ,  their response was  ' we don ' t do that .  '  uhh ,  what ?  first of all ,  that ' s crazy .  why not ?  !  doesn ' t every store on earth do that ?  second of all ,  please be polite .  .  especially as a manager .  i will never frequent this giant eagle again ,  even if it ' s an emergency .  ew . 
__label__3 i eat at their cafe at least once a week ,  the food is great- fresh salad options always fully stocked in their cold bar and a lot of comfort food with options always changing .    i love their bakery ,  everything is well made and delicous .   items are a bit overpriced ,  but you ' ll find that at any giant eagle .   my biggest issue with this giant eagle is the pharmacy ,  i don ' t need it often but whenever i do it ' s a nightmare .  i go every 3 months for a 90 day prescription- i have to use the generic of this prescription to avoid side effects so i make sure i tell them .  first time they told me it would be ready in 20 minutes .  an hour later they finally tell me that they don ' t carry the generic brand .  i have to ask if they would call another pharmacy and see if another location carries it .  every other pharmacy i ' ve been to would offered to call .    yesterday i needed two prescriptions for my cat .  i was told 20-30 minute wait .  i ran to the pet store for some additional shopping and came back 30 minutes later ,  not ready .  an hour and a half later ,  it ' s finally ready ,  then the pharmacist asks why my dog needs the prescription .  first of all ,  it ' s for a cat ,  they never asked me but they put her in the system as a dog .  secondly ,  she ' s the pharmacist and should know what it ' s for especially since these prescriptions were very small doses of common human medications .  it really bothers me that the pharmacist didn ' t know what they were used for and didn ' t care cat v . s .  dog .  they are very different animals who need different treatment ,  i called my vet this morning to make sure that the generic they gave me of one of the meds was the same thing because i don ' t trust their judgment . 
__label__1 came here because of the two prior reviews .  was hoping to get a "do not duplicate" duplicated .   the moment i showed the key ,  she said she can ' t do it .  not sure if they saw a different worker ,  but i was in and out in less than a minute . 
__label__5 yum !  i was taking a class above this deli and it definitely rose above all the other restaurants in the area .  all of the fried ,  greasy ,  overpriced food in the galleria next door doesn ' t even come close to my craving for this place .    my class was three weeks long and i had breakfast here about four or five times ,  and it didn ' t break the bank .  they have a breakfast special for $4 . 95 and includes eggs ,  hash browns ,  meat ,  and toast .  i opted for the breakfast crossaint and it was huge and delicious with a cup of coffee and my loyalty card  ( $ . 50 off every day )  it came to about 5 bucks .    lunch is well priced too .  i had a turkey sandwich which was freshly sliced from their deli with chips and a pickle for about 6 dollars .  the portions are filling and like i said ,  it is a much healthier and less expensive option than the food court across the street .    the ladies at the counter are always smiling and put you in a great mood !  i needed it when waking up super early to sit through an 8 hour snooze class .  this place is awesome !  if i ' m ever in the area again i know where i ' m eating ! 
__label__3 first things first ,  i absolutely will give this place another shot ,  but i was pretty disappointed by my first visit .   i went on a tuesday with a group of friends who regularly visit local taco nights  ( which we take very seriously .   there ' s even a blog )  .   i was very excited to check it out .   it was definitely very busy ,  and we were told it would be 20-30 minutes for a table .   we were okay with that since we had a larger group .   we eventually got some seats at the bar and grabbed some drinks .   they have a great happy hour ,  and i loved the margarita .   plus ,  their draft beer selection is pretty impressive .   service was pretty slow ,  but ,  again ,  they were very busy .   45 minutes later ,  we check on our table because we are noticing quite a few people leaving .   the hostess tells us that they are waiting on a group to leave and they will seat us .   at this point ,  we ' re pretty hungry and the bartender brings us chips & salsa ,  which we quickly devoured .   i could tell the bartender  ( who we learned was also the owner )  could see is growing impatient .   they offer us a shot of tequila .   yeah ,  alright .   eventually ,  we learn the kitchen is completely overwhelmed and backed up and tacos are taking up to 45 minutes .   they are not seating anyone until they ' re back on track .   a friend goes to edison ' s to get a slice of pizza then returns after eating .   over an hour and a half after our arrival ,  we finally get a table .   over and hour after we expected to get a table .   our server ,  patrick ,  was absolutely fantastic .   super personable  ( and i think he was told about our group and made sure he took good care of us )  .   he warned us that drinks and tacos were taking a while .  so ,  we order drinks and tacos .   drinks take a while ,  but we had already consumed enough that it was okay for us .   i could see others getting frustrated .     patrick comes over a little while and tells me awful news .   they were out of tofu .   i ' m a vegetarian .   not a problem ,  just make them with black beans .   five minutes later ,  they are also out of black beans .   ah hell .   we had already been there for two hours ,  and i was starving ,  and that ' s when i officially became frustrated .   how does a mexican place run out of black beans ?  !   we had already been there for two hours with no tacos .   it was 9:30 at this point .   they offer to buy our tacos .   i assumed it was just the tacos that were on my tab .   so ,  tacos come out ,  and everyone loves them .   they made mine with the fixings i had selected and rice .   the sauces are very good ,  and i liked the shells .   i was underwhelmed due to the lack of protein ,  but i was starving and would have eaten nearly anything at that point .     ultimately ,  they actually bought the entire tables '  tacos ,  which wasn ' t necessary ,  but it was a very nice gesture .   we thanked the bartender / owner before we left because i think he knew the night had been a bit of a disaster ,  especially for our group .   the place has a lot going for it .  the atmosphere is great ,  the patio is fantastic ,  and the tacos and guacamole were great .   i think they need to work out the new restaurant kinks .  .  .  then i ' ll go back . 
__label__5 i had the best taco i ' ve ever had yesterday at warped tour .  and it was vegan .  love it .  it may have been the best thing i ' ve ever eaten in my life . 
__label__4 add another new hip place to visit in the revitalized tremont area .  barrio is a mix between your neighborhood bar and trendy restaurant with a cool take on tacos ,  tequila and whisky .  for around $4 each you can build your own own tacos with their list of meats and toppings and grab a drink for around $7 from their selections of different margaritas ,  whisky cocktails and other libations .  the summer time is great with their huge outdoor patio ,  though it tends to fill up quick and could be a little wait if you want to sit outside .    the service is amazingly fast and since it was out first time ,  our server was helpful in explaining how everything worked from ordering on the menu ,  to recommending drinks ,  and suggesting starting us out with a huge bowl of guacamole  ( a meal in itself !  )  .  the food came out within minutes of our order and tasted fantastic .  the portions are pretty enormous as well .    the bottom line is the food ,  the drinks ,  the ambiance ,  and the service make this a great place .  would highly recommend and can ' t wait to go back . 
__label__5 loved it .  .  . worth the drive and  ( possible )  wait .   service was attentive .  .  . and the tacos to die for .   i had chicken ,  green goddess ,  jicama slaw ,  corn salsa ,  chipotle honey aloli .   my daughter had green goddess shell with chicken ,  tomatoes ,  cilantro ,  onions corn salsa ,  cilantro lim aoili .  .  .  .  . and my margarita was perfect .   i will be back . 
__label__5 fantastic food !   the grouper tacos are outstanding and pork was great too .  seriously fresh ingredients .  chips ,  queso and guacamole yum !   enjoyed my favorite blood orange margarita with sugar on the rim !    great value too .   my daughter ' s first stop after coming home from a 4 month stay in spain was barrio !  keep it up ! 
__label__4 i ' m not a big mexican / taco fan but i appreciated being able to make my own and get something i enjoyed .  everyone else at my table really loved theirs .  might not be worth the wait for me  ( again ,  i ' d rather go for just about any other cuisine )  ,  but i think my group enjoyed there ' s enough to come back . 
__label__5 the tacos are great !  the only negative thing i could say is that some of the tables are really crammed next to one another . 
__label__5 had a great experience !  our waiter was incredibly funny and knowledgeable and chatted amiably with us when he found out we were from michigan .    the margarita flight is a must try if you like margaritas .  the best one i tried was the mango with a spicy salt rim .  my second favorite was the blood orange with a salt rim and my least favorite  ( although it was still awesome )  was the pomegranate with a sugar rim .  we also had the trio of guacamoles ,  and they were all good--pineapple ,  smoked trout ,  and goat cheese .  i loved the blistered shishito peppers--i could eat them all day every day !  they were great in the tacos as well .  three of us got tacos ,  and i got the beef short rib tamales ,  which were kind of like a deconstructed tamale ,  with the short rib meat on top of the corn masa .  all of it was delicious !  for dessert ,  we got the vanilla bean flan ,  which was very smooth and full of real vanilla bean specks ,  but i ' m not sure that i ' d get it again  ( just personal preference )  .    making reservations was a breeze ,  and i appreciated the reminder phone call the day of our reservation .  i ' d come back again when i ' m in cleveland ! 
__label__1 i ' ve been a server so i can understand a night when the kitchen gets backed up and you need your manager to go out and smooth things over with the customers .   the manager offers a free round of drinks or dessert .   momocho doesn ' t have a manager like that .   after an hour plus wait for the table and an hour wait for your entree he comes out with an insincere apology and no offer of anything .   not a single chip !   i ' ve never been to momocho before and won ' t be going back .   if you are from the east side head to lopez .   at least lopez gives you some chips to eat during the wait .   the food was ok but not worth a second trip even if there is no wait . 
__label__5 excellent mexican with a unique menu .  the wild boar is cooked very well and has lots of flavor .  the guacamole is probably the standout with a bunch of very cool ,  unique flavors  ( the goat cheese one is really good )  .   service is great .  . everyone is really friendly .   pro tip: don ' t eat outside if it ' s going to rain .  3 / 4 through our meal it started to downpour and the umbrellas did little to protect us or our meals : (  . 
__label__5 words barely serve to do this experience justice .  i say experience because i didn ' t just dine here at momocho ,  i experienced momocho .   normally at a restaurant ,  i ' m hesitant to try what others recommend .  i want to have my own tastes develop and decide for myself what makes something great .  here ,  i couldn ' t help it ,  based on what others had said was good -- everything !   we started as you ought to ,  with the guacamole sampler and ice cold beers .  the traditional was amazing ,  the blue cheese and garlic confit divine .  the goat cheese lacked a certain panache ,  but ,  it was not for lack of trying .  we nearly made the mistake of filling ourselves full with just the guacamole ,  though we calmed ourselves down ,  our voracious appetites begging us for just one more bite after one more bite .  we sampled a margarita flight ,  and fell in love with each flavor .  the tequila was amazingly smooth and complimented our traditional ,  pineapple and mango margaritas .   and then ,  it was time for our entrees ,  and not a moment too soon .  my wife ordered the machaca ,  and it was amazing .  the beef was cooked just to the point where the collagen broke down ,  and created it ' s own sauce with the coffee and ancho ,  the peppers and onions .  our dining partners had the pato  ( roasted duck )  and the bistec ,  each one as good as the last .  i ordered the carnitas and sat amazed as hundreds of flavors danced across my palate .  the green sauce was exquisitely vegetal and earthy ,  and the brown hot sauce amazingly hot and sweet at the same time .    the crown jewel of the evening was just around the corner ,  and i was ready for it as i looked my server in the eye and ordered the cucumber margarita .   i was hesitant to drink a fruit i hate .  i don ' t like cukes ,  and i doubt i ever will .  but ,  this ?  this drink made simply of tequila and cucumber juice sang to me as i sipped it carefully .  the first sip was as though i ' d died and gone to heaven .  i almost trembled and fell to my knees to praise el santo ,  who hovered above us ,  just by the kitchen .  i felt like crying out in a harry met sally-esque embarassment ,  screaming  ' yes !  '  over and over .  and those who ' d tasted this brilliance in an eight ounce glass would likely have forgiven my intrusion on their meals .   i will admit that i couldn ' t make it to the fried ice cream ,  though i watched as my wife and our guests tore it apart voraciously .  i wanted to try ,  but ,  i just didn ' t have the strength .   the experience was wonderful .  our server -- eric b .  -- helped our first time to be something we weren ' t expecting ,  which is an experience that while clueless ,  never felt as though we knew nothing .  he took a few moments to describe the menu ,  and nodded with vigor at each choice ,  making each of us feel like we ' d ordered the best thing off the menu .  we sat just in front of the kitchen and watched as this busy restaurant placed order after order ,  the chefs never too busy ,  never too rushed ,  knowing that good food takes time and people would wait .   i want to go again .  tomorrow .  and everyday after that . 
__label__5 amazing !  !  !  guacamole trio appetizer was enough for two people to eat and not finish .  cucumber margaritas are out of this world .  walked in on a friday night when place was slammed and still got excellence service . 
__label__5 i have been to momocho more times than i can count .  .  . each time my experience has been quite awesome .  i have been here for dinner ,  happy hour ,  appetizers ,  and just drinks .     i have never made a reservation for this place and have never had an issue getting in ,  sometimes we ' ve had to eat at the bar ,  but i really have no problems with that .  even though i have never had issues getting in  ( i live just a few houses away and usually only go in the middle of the week to avoid the crowds )  i would still recommend making a reservation if your heart is set on eating here .   living close by ,  i have seen lines to get in before they even open on friday and saturday nights .   when you go here ,  you have to order the guacamole and margaritas ,  so very good .  i think i have had almost all of their guacamole ' s and tasted all of their margaritas .  you really can ' t go wrong with any of the choices ,  but my favorites are- guacamole- goat cheese; gouda; and crab  ( these are the main ingredients in each one ,  they do contain other delicious flavors )  .  this comes with a big basket of house made tortilla chips ,  perfectly cooked and salted .  you will not be able to stop eating these .  the margaritas - red bell pepper ,  spicy mango and the cucumber ,  each come with a spicy pepper salt rim and a perfectly spicy taste .  the guacamole and margaritas are also served as samplers ,  you can choose three different kinds and taste more than one flavor .   ( singles approx .  $8; samplers approx $15 )  .   my usual dishes are the carnitas  ( pork )  ,  machaca  ( beef brisket )  and tinga  ( grilled chicken skewers )  .  these are also my favorites .  the machaca can be a little on the salty side ,  but still delicious .  these all come with tiny corn tortillas and two sauces on the side ,  a green tomatillo and an additional sauce specific for each dish .  carnitas has a honey-chile chipotle sauce that i want to just drink straight from the bowl ,  machaca has a side of the traditional guacamole and the chicken has their house made pico de gallo .   ( approx .  $15 per dish )   definitely try to come here if you haven ' t already ,  or visit their other location in lakewood  ( el carnicero )  ,  also great food and a little more variety  ( they have tamales )  .   just remember this is not traditional mexican food ,  it ' s mod-mex .  .  . equally delicious ,  just a little different than traditional .   also this isn ' t the cheapest of places to eat .   when we come for a full course ,  margaritas ,  guacamole and dinner it is definitely for a special occasion .  otherwise we stop by for happy hour ,  a couple drinks and a guacamole . 
__label__5 we showed up on a saturday night around 9:30 and found a seat at the bar without a problem ,  which we were pretty psyched about since we ' d heard the wait can be pretty intense .   i ordered a blood orange margarita and like some other reviewers ,  was sort of disappointed they were pre-mixed .  that being said ,  our guacamole was awesome and the mahi mahi tacos were delicious !  the bartenders were pretty friendly ,  too- can ' t wait to go back ! 
__label__5 i met a friend here on wednesday around 6 pm to take advantage of the happy hour specials .  i grabbed two seats at the bar while i waited for her to arrive .  there were a few happy hour drink specials ,  but ultimately i decided to try a margarita .  it didn ' t taste fresh ,  like it was made with a mix or something .  i wasn ' t paying attention while he made it .    once she arrived we decided to try the margarita sampler and those were much better .  the spicy mango was my favorite .  we split an order of the goat cheese guac and both ordered the chicken tinga  ( half price for hh )  and everything was delicious .    i ' ll definitely be back to try more menu items preferably around happy hour because of the specials .    we were both lucky enough to park in the small parking lot so that was a bonus . 
__label__5 food is great .  i highly suggest this place .  don ' t forget to reserve a table .  this place gets crowded and if you don ' t have reservations you should wait more than a hour .  i had lam shank which was great .  i enjoyed my time in this place
__label__4 a friend and i had dinner at momocho last night before hitting the house of blues for a show .  he made the reservations a couple of weeks in advance and they were packed !  they warn you when making a reservation  ( and it ' s printed on the menu )  that the reservations are based on a "two hour dining experience . " we were there for about an hour a 45 minutes .    i liked that we weren ' t rushed at all and i enjoyed taking our time with the meal .  the awesome food was certainly a bonus too !   we started out with the blue cheese and garlic confit guacamole and the spicy salsa verde with chips .  both were very tasty .   my friend had the mole pork chop and he wouldn ' t even share a bite !  he said it was fantastic .  i had the duck confit tacos with a pomegranate bbq sauce and the spicy salsa verde .  they were wonderful and the portion was very large .  i took about half of it home with me .  sooooo good .    i had a regular margarita and also their special margarita - a cucumber one with a spicy red pepper salt on the rim of the glass .  so ,  so ,  so tasty .  delicious !   great place .  super cute decor ,  fantastic service ,  great location ,  wonderful food . 
__label__5 motorcars body shop couldn ' t have been better .  .  . friendly service ,  timely repair work and my car looks like new .  very professional staff  ( sherman )  who is kind and courteous .  motorcars again gives superior service way beyond my expectation .  i highly recommend them for body shop work as well as general service work . 
__label__5 i managed to scrape up my civic when backing out of my garage .  felt like an idiot .  but bill hickey at the motorcars body shop was great .  he let me bring the car in immediately for an estimate .  the following week i returned and bill made sure the scrapes were buffed out and the car looked great .  he even drove me to the waiting room because the weather was bad so i ' d have a comfortable place to wait-tv ,  fireplace , etc .  the repair took about an hour and i was out of there .  i ' d definitely use the motorcars body shop again and would highly recommend it . 
__label__3 let me start by saying that a ton of people like this place .  i however am not sold on it .  it looks really cool when you just stand in there - chandeliers ,  and the second level is a wrap around that looks down on the first .  but nowhere that you sit is comfortable .  the booths are oddly squishy ,  and we are all average sized people .  the tables downstairs are all really close to to other tables and not at all intimate .    the food was ok ,  they have a couple of options that are gluten free where you don ' t feel like you ' re missing anything .  the drinks were small for the price but decent .   we have been here three times at the insistence of friends and never have i been very impressed . 
__label__4 the red velvet cakes melts in your mouth .  gumbo came out quick and it is so delicious .   bbq chicken .  it very spicy and moist .   everything was so good and service excellent .   we ' ll be back ! 
__label__4 excellent service .  prices very reasonable .  food was delicious .  i ' ve been to new orleans and this was as close as you ' re going to get in northeast ohio to the authentic flavors of nola !  the shrimp and grits were excellent .  our table shared desserts -the beignets and bread pudding .  very tasty ! 
__label__5 great customer service .  lisa was an excellent waitress .  we had a party of 9 all our orders were correct including the delicious drinks .  i had the fried oyster for an app and they were amazing !  i will be returning soon .  great way to celebrate fat tuesday !  woooohooo
__label__4 excellent modern mexican food .  had the shredded wild bore  !  really good .  also sampled other dishes my friends had .  absolutely fabulous  ! 
__label__3 to be fair in this review ,  i feel its important to point out that i lived in the southwest  ( az ,  tx ,  and nm )  for 12 years and had lots of authentic mexican food of all different varieties .  since cleveland isn ' t exactly a mexican hot-bed ,  maybe i should have set my expectations lower but after i saw it on diner ' s drive-ins and dives ,  i figured it had to be nothing less than amazing and decided to check it out for myself .   first of all ,  momocho is kind of in a rougher area .  although there is some gorgeous architecture around ,  the area is littered with homeless people and after walking around a bit my wife and i felt somewhat unsafe .  momocho ,  however ,  is quite a nice place inside .  it is kind of surprising that it is located there .  the feeling of the restaurant is somewhat swanky and upscale .  we chose to sit outside  ( which is thankfully fenced in )  and that area was also fairly nice .   we found the staff to be somewhat cold ,  although not exactly rude .  they definitely weren ' t very helpful ,  which would have been nice since the menu is extremely confusing .    the menu options are basically guacamole and taco .  the only real choices are what goes on / in them .  you can choose between a bunch of different types of guac and the tacos give you the choice of what kind of meat / dressings go in them .  we chose the pineapple guac and i got the boar tacos  ( my wife got pork )  .    although people generally rave about their guac ,  i found it fairly flavorless and somewhat disappointing .  i could barely taste the pineapple .  also ,  our tacos were very salty and vinegary .    i ' m guessing my taste was biased due to my experience with mexican food but nonetheless ,  it was disappointing .  it was also very expensive .  in my opinion ,  it was overpriced .  the food certainly wasn ' t terrible ,  but it was very mediocre ,  and not note-worthy .   i probably won ' t go back . 
__label__2 i really wanted to like momocho ,  but unfortunately ,  this experience just didn ' t deliver .  the hostess was really nice and squeezed in a table for us on new years eve ,  and then proceeded to seat us immediately when we came in .  however ,  the experience did go downhill from there .    we got our tables close to 7:45 ,  by which time the restaurant was not as busy as earlier in the evening .  however ,  it took a good 15-20 minutes before we were able to get the attention of any server  ( despite me waving at one )  .  the drink orders were decent and the guacamole was pretty good ,  however the chips serving was not very much - just an average sized bowl .  this would not have been an issue if they were not charging $8 . 50 for a guacamole serving ,  and $2 for each chip refill .    for the main course ordered the chilli relleno ,  which was pretty good ,  a beetroot taco dish which was ok ,  and their best beef tacos ,  which ,  honestly were tough .  we ' ve had more tender meat at a taco bell .   overall ,  it seemed like a place that had potential .  there were definitely sparks of greatness  ( cucumber margarita and chilli rellenos )  .  however ,  the overall experience just was not what i was expecting . 
__label__5 tho place was awesome .  great service ,  great margaritas ,  great apps ,  great dinner ,  great desert . 
__label__4 came here saturday night after an indians game .  no reservation and didnt realize you need one ( our fault )  as they had about a 90 minute wait but they were very open to letting us hover the bar until a seat opened up .  to the point they told us where to hover as a couple just paid there check .  and then after we sat came back to us about 10 minutes later came to us and said they had a table if we wanted it but we had settled into the bar nicely .   food was super delicious .  we shared the guac sampler getting the goat cheese ,  pineapple and crab to share ( this was easily enough for 5 people ,  as we left with containers of guac at the end my fiance has the ahi tuna tacos and i had the duck tacos .  the ahi tuna was seared perfectly and had great flavor .  i probably had close to  . 5 pound of duck on my plate ,  much more then i was expecting .  my only flaw was i wish the taco shells were a bit bigger .  but great food and great drinks as well .  we will be back ! 
__label__3 this restaurant is really hyped up .  the food is sub-par ,  lacked flavor ,  too much salt ,  and over priced for what you get .  we made a reservation in advance ,  and still had to wait an additional hour .  our waiter was awkward and the atmosphere was just okay .  positives: the drinks are reasonably priced and parking was ample ! 
__label__4 i ' ve been back twice since the original review; this place is just fantastic .  i highly ,  highly recommend the cucumber margarita if they have it .  it ' s amazing .  if they have the smoked gouda dumplings when you go ,  you must get them .  they are cheesy ,  puffy clouds sent from heaven . 
__label__1 my friend got drugged here on her bachelorette party and ended up in the hospital after only consuming one drink .  sketchy .  no thanks . 
__label__3 i may have done shots here .  i may have gotten crazy wasted here and tried to take my shirt off outside ,  even though it was two degrees .  did i .  .  . did i ride that mechanical bull ?  oh dear lord .  .  . i did .  there ' s photographic evidence on my cell phone .  sweet jesus . 
__label__1 horrible place !  sticky floors ,  worn furniture ,  and the drinks were watered down and expensive . 
__label__4 ok ,  so here ' s the deal - it ' s little caesars pizza where you can get a large pizza for $5 .  not some specialty italian gourmet restaurant where the chef did a 6 month internship in a world renowned pizzeria to learn the ways of generational pizza making .   with that said ,  it ' s decent ,  borderline good pizza .  i prefer the deep dish and their cheese breadsticks .  they also have a nice variety of sodas  ( they had dr .  pepper which is a rarity )  .   the employees are decent .  except once i pulled up 5 minutes before closing .  a guy literally leaped over the counter to lock the door and turn off the "open" light sign .    um .  rude .   but it ' s essentially fast food so i don ' t expect much from them .  as long as my food is edible and no one insults / assaults me ,  i ' m good . 
__label__3 flew us airways again and they didn ' t lose my suitcase .   the flight was much more smooth and it was a much better experience all around .   giving back one star since my last review . 
__label__5 the best food you will find in a hole in the wall cleveland bar !  !  !  !  such a shocker .  . amazing food and very friendly people !  the best french fries around ,  my favorite would be the meatloaf or pizza ' s !  a tasty treat for everyone ,  and great daily specials !  ! 
__label__4 the kitchen is inside another bar ,  but they work very well together .  great selection ,  food was delicious and huge portions .  sit down restaurant style food fused into a bar friendly menu . 
__label__1 i have been a costco member for years .  i even have an amex costco credit card .  this location has very poor service and i felt very mistreated .  i wanted to buy one bottle of wine .  i had my photo amex costco credit card ,  but forgot my license .  i ' ve done this before and they ' ve looked up my dob in their database .  i ' m 37 .  at this location ,  they made me wait for 20 minutes , giving the impression that they were helping me out ,  but at the end of 20 minutes ,  the "manager" says ,  i can ' t prove that you are over 21 .   ?  ?  ?  you know ,  i get it .  i forgot my license .  but it upsets me to make me wait 20 minutes and waste my time .  then they gave me the wrong credit card back .  i had to drive all the way back after i realized it .  of course they mixed it up with another asian woman .  she said it best- "it ' s because we all look alike" .  awful experience ,  service ,  and wish i had never gone ,  and will not return . 
__label__4 i didn ' t know going to costco could become a hobby ,  but now i do .  i come here with no intention of buying anything but it is costco ,  and you ' re bound to walk out of this place with something .  there is something for everyone !   i bought a floral arrangement here for $30 ,  where at a florists it would be at least $90+  ( if you ' ve purchased an arrangement from a floral shop ,  you know what i ' m talking about )  .  also ,  the samples spread throughout this place are amazing ,  omg i can ' t stop eating when i ' m here .  it is a good sales tactic ,  you try it and love it and want more .  .  .  ugh so good .   the pizza is delicious and cheap .  out of curiosity ,  i looked up the calorie count on the pizza .  one slice = 700 calories .  luckily ,  my friend and i split one piece down the middle  ( 350 calories but still ,  wow )  .  beware . 
__label__4 costco is a wholesale club that is far higher quality than you would expect !  the complimentary food and beverage samples that they serve are enjoyable and plentiful ,  especially on the weekends .    this costco is fairly new and well layed out .  i usually find what i am looking for immediately ,  and if i do not ,  a friendly and knowledgeable employee will assist me .  not only do they have great buys ,  but it is fun to shop there !  it truly is an experience .    although ,  there are a few problems .  .  .  it would be nice if they stocked more men ' s cologne for my husband .  it would also be convenient to have some home furnishings for sale ,  as well .    the parking lot is not good ,  to be frank .  there are cars coming and going in every direction ,  and people walking out with industrial size toilet paper and tissue boxes that don ' t look where they are going .  i think that it would be safer for everyone if they had an employee directing traffic .  also ,  there are always carts strewn about in the middle of the lot . 
__label__4 although this costco is a bit hard to get too off the highway ,  it has a nice selection of merchandise and the gas bar is close .  unfortunately a couple of the pumps were out of service making for longer lines .  there is lots of parking for the warehouse . 
__label__5 i love costco .  simple as that .  i think costco is my favorite of the big quantity retailers .  i love that there are employees everywhere to help you with whatever you need ,  and also handing out samples : )  their prices are great if you pay attention to their adds .  the first time you go ,  expect to want everything !  but pace yourself and you won ' t be poor on the way out ! 
__label__5 for those of us ,  i mean you ,  that prefer target because you ' re "too good" to go to walmart ,  costco is your big box warehouse club equivalent .   the options are great in terms of housewares ,  clothing ,  electronics ,  food and produce  ( excellent )  ,  and even vision and car services .  it also lives up to our ,  er i mean your store ambiance requisites ,  in terms of organization ,  cleanliness ,  associate mood and tone ,  volume level ,  etc .  - pretty much ratchetness free ,  if i may .   the only drawback might be the membership fee at $55 for basic ,  vs .  $35 at the other clubs ,  i believe ?  ?  could be wrong there ,  and if so ,  the point is moot .  if i ' m correct ,  however ,  people i described at the top of the view would gladly pay the difference to separate themselves .  .  . i ' m guessing ;- ) 
__label__5 been coming here a year plus ,  averaging 4 times a month .  i have yet to be disappointed with the high quality of the food and the pleasant people working there .  always a smile .    i don ' t understand people that say they love it ,  but only give 4 stars .  .  .  this isn ' t noma .  this is a great cafeteria putting out fast ,  consistent and solidly performing food for a lunch time office crowd .    best sushi downtown .  .  .  period .   ( i wish they would do more daily specials )  perfect and non-boring salad bar w great choices of house made dressings .   ( and the weigh charge doesn ' t include the weight of the dressing if you put it on the side !  )  braised items are home cooked goodness .   nice dinning space overlooking the atrium or walk to the public square side for an exceptional view of the soldiers & sailors monument .  i like to take my food across the street to the eastman reading garden or mall c for a real cleveland experience for lunch . 
__label__4 this place is exactly what it sounds like ,  a cafeteria ,  but minus the mystery meat .  it is another zack bruell masterpiece of a restaurant .  if you have ever been to a bruell restaurant ,  expect all the great flavors and fresh ,  wholesome ingredients within the $8-15 price range .  the first time i went the lines were pretty long so i opted for the selections in the grab & go cooler .  even the pb&j was fancy as it was topped with banana mousse !  i might ask for just a cup of that next time .  .  .  definitely go for an early or later lunch to avoid the lines .  the friends i was with tried the pasta station and thanked me after for taking them here .  hoping to try the breakfast menu next ,  but so far i ' m a fan . 
__label__4 always a joy when they pull up to cia on tuesdays !  they change the menu each week  ( see their web page )  with a few standards ,  such as the pblt ,  that stay in each rotation .  i like their experiments with tater tots ! 
__label__5 i concur with the rest of the reviewers - dim and den sum rocks !   after weeks of stalking the truck and never being able to make it to their location ,  i finally tracked them down at star plaza in playhouse square .  i had the pblt ,  tots and an apple soda .   holy mouthgasm it was freaking delicious .   now that they have an iphone app  ( http: /  / bit . ly / aq8vnb )  ,  and they accept credit cards ,  they are a lot more accessible .  .  . and i ' ll be quite a frequent customer .   now .  .  . go and get sum ! 
__label__1 this particular applebee ' s is ran very poorly .  the manager walks around on purpose with purpose because he knows his servers are not providing quality service .  ! 
__label__3 i have had one positive experience here  ,  and one extremely bad .   the first came when i ordered a large pizza with pep and cheese on it .   it was perfect ,  delicious ,  crisp and butter crust .   everything you would want in a pizza .   so this outcome warrented another order .   however ,  this is when the shit hit the fan .  the buzzer rings and i tell the delivery man i am on my way down .   it was mere moments before i got down there and the guy had a look on his face as if i decided to take a shower and shave before coming down .  seriously ,  it was maybe 90 seconds before i got down there .   the pizza was on the ground and the guy had a horrible atitude about him .   ( now ,  this is partly my fault ,  i should of inspected the pizza before i let him leave ,  but i guess i just didn ' t think i needed to .  .  )  anyways ,  i pay the guy and take the zaza upstairs .  everything had slid off the pizza .   the cheese was over the crust ,  and there was nothing left on the pizza itself .   when the delivery guy set the pizza down ,  he set it down violently and at an angle .   this lead to one of the worst pizza experiences i have ever had .   i am still unsure if i will ever order from here again . 
__label__5 love their sausage !  sausage pizza ,  sausage sandwich or sausage on pasta .  it is the best tasting sausage around .  love papa nick ' s freshness and quality .  just about everything is home made: sauce ,  meatballs ,  chicken and veal ,  soups .  .  . the list goes on and on .  it ' s a gem of a place . 
__label__3 first thing first .  .  . they deliver !  !  !  ordered pizza here for the first time last night and was semi-impressed .  i was super excited that they delivered ,  cause i didn ' t want chain pizza and wanted to try something new .   we ordered a large sausage ,  onion ,  green pepper pizza and came to our door piping hot !  the pizza was kinda on the thin side .  only downfall was it was kinda burnt on the bottom .  definitely will give it another try ! 
__label__3 the bread sticks were awesome .  the pizza was good ,  but had a bit too much sauce .  my friend liked the buffalo chicken wrap . 
__label__1 unfortunately ,  we ' ve been disappointed the last 2 times we ' ve gone .  originally ,  heard about this place on new day cleveland in 2016 .  our first few times ,  the pizzas were yeasty and tasty .  not so much lately .  the latest pizzas we ' ve ordered were almost "cracker like" thin ,  and tasteless ,  crusty dough .  don ' t know if there has been a change of ownership or chefs which may explain the difference .  i have not tried the deep dish style but don ' t know if i will return to try it .  disappointed because i prefer to patronize independent restaurants instead of the big chain ones . 
__label__3 we only ate here because my parents had frequented this shop when they were first married .  i ' m extremely disappointed we didn ' t keep driving a little further to melt !  their pizza is just ok .  if you live close and want something to eat ,  i would check it out ,  i wouldn ' t go out of my way to go here though .  i wouldn ' t ever go out of my way to eat here again ,  but if i had to eat here i wouldn ' t be too upset either .  it was just ok .    our waitress was very friendly ,  they have an interesting pop selection ,  the place was pretty clean .  the bathroom is in a slightly creepy basement . 
__label__5 the pizza is fantastic .  the ingredients are always fresh .  i have never had a bad experience .  plus ,  they have a wide range of delivery !  great news for this west parker .  5stars ,  every time
__label__3 i have tried a few of their sandwiches .   they are really good and plenty of fillings .   my only complaint on them is the heavy handed salt content .   really salty .   delivery is quick and food is always hot .   just need to lighten up on the salt and then i ' d give it a 5 . 
__label__5 i ' m excited to be the first reviewer of the new porcelli ' s bistro in the tremont area of cleveland !  it ' s so new that it doesn ' t have it ' s own website or phone # listed yet anywhere on the web .  if you want to get an idea ,  check out the website listed for porcelli ' s at their longtime e .  6th st .  location downtown .  porcelli ' s bistro in tremont is located where the bistro on lincoln park used to be situated .  it ' s brand new  ( only been open about 2 weeks )  ,  so they may still be working out the kinks ,  but we had a wonderful dinner there !   the ambiance / setting: i love the decor here - very stylish ,  but comfortable .  there ' s a bar where you can just sit & have a drink .  there are three separate eating areas ,  all nicely decorated with a muted italian theme .  oh ,  there ' s an outdoor patio on the front that overlooks lincoln park .    the food: it was so hard to choose - everything looked delicious !  !  there were a couple of specials listed up on the board and my sis-in-law tried one - a mixed seafood cioppino  ( stew w /  some pasta )  that was very tasty .  we had the baked brie as an appetizer - yum !  all entrees come with a really nice salad - fresh & tasty .  the menu has some meals  ( per our server )  that are the same as downtown ,  but there ' s many more different ,  interesting items - i think !  .  my niece got a pasta dish with a lobster cream sauce - wow .  there were so many interesting seafood / fish dishes i wanted to try ,  but i ended up getting a pasta carbonara dish w /  pancetta that was delicious .  i know it was good because the others that i was with kept reaching across the table and trying my dish !   the drinks: a nice selection of wines ,  drink specials and beer .  i had an italian red wine that was great !   the staff: the waitstaff and bartender are friendly ,  personable ,  capable and very efficient .  i know that at least some of them have also worked / currently work at porcelli ' s on e .  6th so they know the menu quite well .  if they don ' t ,  they ' re very willing to go find out the info from the chef ! 
__label__4 we loved everything from start to finish .  we came in with a group and had wonderful service .  each of us enjoyed our dishes .  the wine was maybe a little over priced ,  but the selection was good .  the place was empty though .  .  .  seems the location is a tough one- places come and go .  but i liked it here ,  hope to go back soon ,  and i hope it picks up for them .  they deserve good business ! 
__label__5 arrived in cleveland for a quick weekend getaway and went to porcelli ' s based on a yelp search and reviews .   fabulous meal !   the food was prepared with such high quality and you could tell the ingredients were of the highest caliber !    i had the lobster ravioli and it was scrumptious .   whether you are visiting or a cleveland native - this meal is well worth the trip
__label__1 just no .   unless your idea of a fun shopping experience involves being judged by your sales associates .   see ,  i have what other ' s  ( and my husband )  might call a slight handbag problem .   i have a lot of them and i ' m always looking for a new ,  fun brand .   i had stumbled across a gorgeous blue linea pelle bag online that i just had to have for christmas .   because i had no experience with that brand - i wanted to check it out in person to see what the color and leather were really like .   none of the big mall stores carried it ,  so when i saw that it was carried at kilgore trout i felt really excited !   and they carried botkier !  i ' m sold !   the girl working the handbag section was really sweet with great customer service and i felt like i would maybe be coming back to purchase a bag for christmas .   that is ,  until we stepped into the men ' s wear section for my husband to look around and the sale ' s guy from that side literally said to us "you guys just trying to get out of the cold ? " as he ate his lunch .   what !  ?  no .  we ' re not trying to "get out of the cold . " we ' re trying to shop at your store d-bag .   i ' m sorry if we don ' t look like we want to buy $400 t-shirts ,  but ya know ,  there really were items that we were going to purchase !   i was really trying to shop local for some of our big ticket items ,  but i ' m going to be ordering this one online .  = ( 
__label__1 apparently nothing has changed in the age old door-to-door vacuum business since the 80 ' 2 when i was selling vorwerks .  i get a knock on the door from some cute girl saying she needs to raise money and could "she" vacuum one area rug .  "it won ' t cost me anything .  she gets paid by the company . " i said "ok" 5 minutes later two guys show up .  it ' s the same old bait & switch but the rug needs vacuuming so i figure what the hell .  the kid comes in and starts opening this monstrosity of a vacuum cleaner that looks like it could have been used to stop a tank .  "$2600 !  !  ! " no ,  that ' s not even true .  it ' s actually $3600 ,  but hey ,  who ' s counting ,  right ?  i already told all of them that the house is sold and the rugs will be thrown away in a couple weeks .  still the kid ,  james ,  starts showing meet dirt samples he ' s picked up from the rug .  as if i wouldn ' t believe otherwise that a 20 year old rug might have dirt in it .  the thing weighs a ton .  but you ' re not supposed to pick it up by the handle .  you ' re supposed to bend down ,  at the risk of back injury ,  and grab it by the hand hold near the bottom .  i guess maybe if you pick it up by the handle it might break .  what a p . o . s .  anyway ,  after it becomes obvious that i ' m not buying ,  james tells me he forgot to bring his lunch money and could he earn $20 in some way .  wtf ?  i shudder to think what he had in mind by that .  i told him if he was out of the house in 5 minutes i wouldn ' t give him a negative yelp review .  7 minutes later he ' s still here ,  trying to get $20 .  and he left dirt samples on the kitchen counter . 
__label__3 overall ,  a very nice convention center that i recently visited while at a conference a couple of months ago .  the main lobby was beautiful ,  with large windows of a nice view of downtown .  the first snow storm of the year came through while i was there ,  and it was actually beautiful to see from the inside .  additionally ,  the large room for all of the poster sessions and vendors was nice .  a big drawback for me was that the wifi was crap ,  and orienting around the center wasn ' t completely intuitive  ( until you learned where particular rooms were located )  . 
__label__1 this was the worst chinese food i ever ate in cleveland .  i love chinese food ,   i went there tuesday evening .  i ordered a shrimp egg foo young combination with chicken fried rice and  ( 4 )  wings .    after waiting 20 minutes for my order which was no problem because i love my food hot and fresh .   they forgot to put my wings in the bag so i had to turn around and go back .  the lady at the counter threw in an extra wing for my troubles .  ok cool .   i get home open my food take a bit of my egg foo young it taste burnt and it taste like it was dipped in some fish oil giving it a medicine taste of father johns cold medicine ,  and the rice was hard .  the wings were hard and old looking when i broke the wing open the meat was brown .   they tasted like old dirty grease .  i drove from shaker hts to turney road plaza for this garbage food .  never again in life will i eat there and i ' ll discourage anyone i know from eating there including my dog ! 
__label__3 really large store ,  resembles an old grocery store maybe ?   was told to check it out ,  so we did being in the area .  walked in and caught that instant thrift aroma of must and unwashed clothes ,  but noticed there ' s tons of stuff here besides that .    i usually only go to thrifting for old shirts ,  jackets and shoes ,  so i ' m probably giving a bias review but there was a lot of electronics and kids clothes ,  just not much of my taste .    staff was friendly ,  working in the aisles trying not to get in the way .  some sketchy dudes shopping in here though lol   i guess maybe it depends on what day you visit this place but i didnt find much that sparked my interest or made me come out of my wallet either .  maybe try one of the other unique thrift locations .
